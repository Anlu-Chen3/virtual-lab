Each of these three tools can be used to score a nanobody mutation based on how the mutation affects binding to an antigen. Your goal is to start with an existing nanobody and iteratively add mutations to it to improve its binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in 24 modified nanobodies with one or more mutations. Please determine how to use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in this iterative design process. An important constraint is that ESM can evaluate all potential mutations to a nanobody in 5 minutes while AlphaFold-Multimer takes 30 minutes per mutation and Rosetta takes five minutes per mutation. The whole iterative process should take no more than a few days to complete. Note that AlphaFold-Multimer must be run before Rosetta on each mutation since Rosetta requires the nanobody-antigen structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer. Additionally, note that ESM log-likelihood ratios are generally in the range of 5-10 (higher is better), AlphaFold-Multimer interface pLDDT confidence scores are generally in the range of 60-80 (higher is better), and Rosetta binding energy scores are generally in the range of -20 to -40 (lower is better).\"\n",
