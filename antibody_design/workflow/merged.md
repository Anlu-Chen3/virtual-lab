This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here are summaries of the previous meetings:

[begin summary 1]

To address the agenda questions and develop a strategy for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in our iterative nanobody design process, here's the proposed plan:

1. **Order of Operations in Each Iteration:**
   - **Step 1:** Use ESM to quickly evaluate all potential mutations to the nanobody. This step gives us a preliminary idea of which mutations might be promising.
   - **Step 2:** For a subset of top mutations from the ESM evaluation, run AlphaFold-Multimer. This step will provide detailed structural predictions of the nanobody-antigen complex.
   - **Step 3:** Use Rosetta to refine and score the structures predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer. This will provide a detailed energy-based assessment of binding affinities.

2. **Number of Mutations Evaluated:**
   - **ESM:** Evaluate all possible single-point mutations. Given the computational efficiency, we can screen all possibilities (~20 mutations per amino acid position).
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta:** Select the top 5% of mutations based on ESM scores for further evaluation. Assuming around 1000 positions on average, this results in evaluating approximately 50 mutations per iteration.

3. **Weighting the Scores:**
   - Combine scores using a weighted average approach: 30% weight to ESM (for preliminary filtering), 40% to AlphaFold-Multimer (for structural prediction), and 30% to Rosetta (for final binding affinity refinement). These weights can be adjusted based on empirical validation of their predictive power in early iterations.

4. **Top-Ranked Mutations for Next Round:**
   - Keep the top 10 mutations based on the combined weighted scores for the next round. This balances depth (evaluating different positions) and breadth (evaluating various mutations at preferred positions).

5. **Total Iterations:**
   - Perform 10 iterations in total. This will allow us to thoroughly explore the mutational landscape while adhering to the time constraint of a few days.

6. **Selection of Final 24 Modified Nanobodies:**
   - At the end of all iterations, select the 24 nanobodies that exhibit the highest combined scores across iterations. Ensure diversity in the mutational profiles to account for potential cross-reactivity against minor and past variants. If necessary, include additional criteria such as stability or manufacturability predictions to refine the final selection.

This plan balances computational efficiency and thoroughness in evaluating potential nanobody mutations, ensuring we can identify and validate promising candidates within the given constraints.

[end summary 1]

[begin summary 2]

To address the agenda questions and efficiently utilize our computational resources for the iterative design process of nanobody modifications, I propose the following plan:

1. **Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations:**

   - **Step 1:** Use ESM to evaluate the binding potential of all possible point mutations on the existing nanobody. This step quickly identifies promising candidates based on sequence-level predictions.
   - **Step 2:** Select a subset of top mutations based on ESM scores and run AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the 3D structure and evaluate the binding affinity with the spike protein.
   - **Step 3:** Use Rosetta to refine the predicted structures from AlphaFold-Multimer and compute further detailed binding energy scores.

2. **Number of Mutations Evaluated in Each Step:**

   - **ESM Evaluation:** Given the rapid evaluation capability (5 minutes for all mutations), we will evaluate all possible point mutations in each iteration.
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation:** Due to the time constraint (1 hour per mutation), we will select the top 10 mutations based on ESM scores for AlphaFold-Multimer evaluation.
   - **Rosetta Evaluation:** Evaluate the same 10 mutations processed by AlphaFold-Multimer using Rosetta, as it takes an additional 5 minutes per mutation.

3. **Weighting of Scores:**

   - At the end of each iteration, we will compute a combined score for each mutation by assigning weights to the scores from each tool: 0.3 for ESM (due to its high throughput but lower structural accuracy), 0.4 for AlphaFold-Multimer (medium throughput and good structural insights), and 0.3 for Rosetta (refinement and detailed binding energy, but more time-consuming).

4. **Selection of Top-Ranked Mutations:**

   - We will retain the top 3 mutations based on the combined score for the next round of iterations. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.

5. **Total Number of Iterations:**

   - We will perform a total of 8 iterations. This number balances the exploration of the mutation space with the resource constraints and timeline, allowing us to refine and converge on the best candidates.

6. **Final Selection of 24 Modified Nanobodies:**

   - After completing all iterations, we will have a pool of mutations from various rounds. We will select the final set of 24 modified nanobodies by considering the diversity of mutations, their combined scores, and structural insights from the iterative process. The selection will focus on ensuring a broad spectrum of activity against the newest SARS-CoV-2 variant and other variants.

This plan should allow us to efficiently explore the mutation landscape and refine our nanobody candidates within the given timeline while leveraging the strengths of each computational tool.

[end summary 2]

[begin summary 3]

To address the agenda questions for the research project on developing enhanced nanobodies against the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant, here's the proposed strategy:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations

In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
1. **ESM**: Evaluate all potential mutations for rapid initial screening.
2. **AlphaFold-Multimer**: Run on a subset of promising mutations identified by ESM to predict the nanobody-antigen structure.
3. **Rosetta**: Apply to the structured outputs from AlphaFold-Multimer to assess the binding affinity and structural stability of the mutations.

### 2. Number of Mutations Evaluated

- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations of the nanobody. If we assume a typical nanobody length of 120 amino acids and each position could mutate to 19 other amino acids, this results in evaluating 2,280 mutations in approximately 5 minutes.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer**: Select the top 50 mutations based on ESM scores for detailed structural prediction. This subset allows for a manageable computational load while providing sufficient diversity of mutations.
- **Rosetta**: Process the same 50 mutations evaluated by AlphaFold-Multimer for detailed energy scoring and ranking.

### 3. Weighting of Scores

At the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a composite score:
- **ESM Score**: Weight of 0.2, since it provides a rapid but less detailed assessment.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer Score**: Weight of 0.4, offering structural insights critical for predicting binding interface changes.
- **Rosetta Score**: Weight of 0.4, as it provides detailed energy calculations and binding affinity estimates.

The weights reflect the balance between computational efficiency and the depth of analysis.

### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep

At the end of each iteration, retain the top 10 mutations based on the composite score for the next round of iterative mutations. This ensures a focused yet diverse exploration of the sequence space.

### 5. Total Number of Iterations

Perform a total of 5 iterations. This number is chosen to balance computational feasibility within the time constraint and the exploration of sufficient combinatorial mutation space to enhance binding affinity.

### 6. Selection of Final 24 Modified Nanobodies

After completing all iterations:
- Compile a list of top mutations from each iteration.
- Use the final composite scores to rank all unique modified nanobodies.
- Select the top 24 nanobodies with the highest overall scores for experimental validation, ensuring that they represent a diverse set of mutations to maximize the chance of discovering broadly effective binders against the new SARS-CoV-2 variant and other circulating variants.

This plan ensures that within a few days, the project can generate a focused, high-quality set of candidate nanobodies for further experimental analysis.

**1. In each iteration, what is the order of operations for evaluating mutations with ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta?**

In each iteration, the order of operations will be as follows:
   - **ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling):** First, use ESM to quickly evaluate all potential mutations to the nanobody. ESM can rapidly assess the likelihood of each mutation improving binding affinity based on evolutionary conservation and other features.
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer:** After shortlisting mutations with ESM, predict the 3D structures of the nanobody-antigen complexes for the top mutations using AlphaFold-Multimer. This step is crucial to evaluate the structural compatibility of mutations within the binding context.
   - **Rosetta:** Finally, use Rosetta on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structures to refine and evaluate the energetic stability and binding affinity of the mutations. Rosetta will provide a more detailed and accurate assessment of the binding interactions.

**2. In each iteration, how many mutations (give a precise number) will you evaluate with ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta?**

- **ESM:** Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody. If we assume 20 possible amino acid substitutions per position and there are around 100 positions that can be mutated, this results in approximately 2,000 mutations.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer:** Select the top 50 mutations from the ESM evaluation for further structural prediction.
- **Rosetta:** Further refine and evaluate these top 50 mutations after structural prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer.

**3. At the end of each iteration, how will you weight the ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta scores to rank the nanobody mutations?**

At the end of each iteration, combine the scores using a weighted approach:
   - **ESM Score:** 20% weight, because it provides an initial filter based on evolutionary insights.
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer Score:** 40% weight, as it provides structural insights into how well each mutation might fit into the antigen binding site.
   - **Rosetta Score:** 40% weight, since it gives detailed energetic and binding affinity information that is crucial for identifying optimal mutations.

**4. At the end of each iteration, how many of the top-ranked mutations (give a precise number) will you keep for the next round?**

Keep the top 10 mutations from the ranked list of 50 mutations for the next round. These mutations will serve as the new starting points for generating further mutations in the next iteration.

**5. How many iterations will you perform in total?**

Perform a total of 5 iterations. This should provide a balance between exploring enough mutation space and the practical constraint of time.

**6. After all of the iterations are complete, how exactly will you select the final set of 24 modified nanobodies for experimental validation?**

After completing all iterations, evaluate the final set of mutations obtained from each iteration. Select a diverse set of 24 nanobodies based on the following criteria:
   - Highest combined scores from ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta.
   - Diversity in sequence and structure to ensure coverage of different potential binding modes.
   - Prioritize mutations that show potential cross-reactivity with other variants based on structural predictions and sequence conservation.

This strategy maximizes the likelihood of identifying nanobodies with increased binding affinity to the target spike protein variant while also offering potential cross-reactivity to other variants.

[begin summary 5]

To address the agenda questions and ensure the successful completion of the project within the given timeframe, we must strategically utilize ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in our iterative nanobody design process. Here is the proposed plan:

1. **Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations:**
   - **Step 1:** Start each iteration by using ESM to quickly evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. ESM's computational efficiency allows us to perform this task rapidly.
   - **Step 2:** Select a subset of the most promising mutations based on ESM scores and run AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen structure for these mutations.
   - **Step 3:** Use Rosetta to refine and score the AlphaFold-Multimer-predicted structures, focusing on the stability and binding affinity of the nanobody-antigen complex.

2. **Number of Mutations Evaluated:**
   - **ESM:** Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the initial sequence (typically hundreds to thousands, depending on the length of the nanobody).
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer:** Due to the time constraint (1 hour per mutation), select approximately 10-15 top-scoring mutations from the ESM evaluation for AlphaFold-Multimer analysis in each iteration.
   - **Rosetta:** Evaluate the same 10-15 mutations with Rosetta, since it follows AlphaFold-Multimer in the workflow and takes 5 minutes per mutation.

3. **Weighting of Scores to Rank Mutations:**
   - Develop a composite scoring system that integrates the outputs of ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta. Assign weights based on the relevance and reliability of each tool's predictions:
     - ESM contributes to initial filtering (30% weight).
     - AlphaFold-Multimer provides structural insights (40% weight).
     - Rosetta refines the binding affinity and stability (30% weight).

4. **Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep:**
   - Keep the top 5 mutations at the end of each iteration for further exploration in the subsequent round. This allows us to focus on the most promising candidates while maintaining diversity in the mutation pool.

5. **Total Number of Iterations:**
   - Plan for 5-6 iterations. This number balances the need for thorough exploration with the time constraints, leading to a manageable pool of final candidates.

6. **Selection of Final 24 Modified Nanobodies:**
   - After completing all iterations, compile a list of top candidates based on cumulative scores from all rounds.
   - Ensure diversity among the selected nanobodies to enhance the likelihood of broad-spectrum activity against multiple variants. This can be done by selecting nanobodies with different sets of mutations.
   - Choose the final 24 nanobodies for experimental validation by considering both the highest composite scores and structural diversity.

By following this plan, we can efficiently explore the mutation space and select the most promising nanobody candidates for experimental validation, adhering to the timeline and resource constraints of the project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Please read the summaries of multiple separate meetings about the same agenda. Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.

As a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has built three components of a nanobody design pipeline: ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta. Each of these three tools can be used to score a nanobody mutation based on how the mutation affects binding to an antigen. Your goal is to start with an existing nanobody and iteratively add mutations to it to improve its binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in 24 modified nanobodies. Please determine how to use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in this iterative design process. An important constraint is that ESM can evaluate all potential mutations to a nanobody in 5 minutes while AlphaFold-Multimer takes 1 hour per mutation and Rosetta takes five minutes per mutation. The whole iterative process should take no more than a few days to complete. Note that AlphaFold-Multimer must be run before Rosetta on each mutation since Rosetta requires the nanobody-antigen structured predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.

As a reference, here are the agenda questions from those meetings, which must be answered here as well:

1. In each iteration, what is the order of operations for evaluating mutations with ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta?

2. In each iteration, how many mutations (give a precise number) will you evaluate with ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta?

3. At the end of each iteration, how will you weight the ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta scores to rank the nanobody mutations?

4. At the end of each iteration, how many of the top-ranked mutations (give a precise number) will you keep for the next round?

5. How many iterations will you perform in total?

6. After all of the iterations are complete, how exactly will you select the final set of 24 modified nanobodies for experimental validation?



Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Based on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan that merges the best components from each individual meeting summary:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations

In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
1. **ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling):** Quickly evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step provides a rapid assessment of each mutation's potential to improve binding affinity based on evolutionary conservation and other features.
2. **AlphaFold-Multimer:** Use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the 3D structures of the nanobody-antigen complexes for the top mutations identified by ESM. This step evaluates the structural compatibility of mutations within the binding context.
3. **Rosetta:** Apply Rosetta to refine and evaluate the energetic stability and binding affinity of the mutations based on the structures predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.

**Rationale:** This order of operations is consistent across all summaries and ensures a logical progression from rapid initial screening to detailed structural and energetic evaluation.

### 2. Number of Mutations Evaluated

- **ESM:** Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody. Assuming a typical nanobody length of 120 amino acids and 19 possible substitutions per position, this results in approximately 2,280 mutations.

**Rationale:** Keeping a smaller number of top mutations (as in summary 5) allows for a more manageable and focused exploration in subsequent iterations.

### 5. Total Number of Iterations

Perform a total of 5 iterations. This number balances computational feasibility within the time constraint and the exploration of sufficient combinatorial mutation space to enhance binding affinity.

**Rationale:** This choice, consistent with summaries 3, 4, and 5, ensures thorough exploration within the given timeline.

### 6. Selection of Final 24 Modified Nanobodies

After completing all iterations:
- Compile a list of top mutations from each iteration.
- Use the final composite scores to rank all unique modified nanobodies.
- Select the top 24 nanobodies with the highest overall scores for experimental validation, ensuring that they represent a diverse set of mutations to maximize the chance of discovering broadly effective binders against the new SARS-CoV-2 variant and other circulating variants.

**Rationale:** This strategy, informed by summaries 3 and 5, ensures a diverse and high-quality set of candidates for experimental validation.

By integrating these components, the plan efficiently utilizes computational resources and maximizes the likelihood of identifying effective nanobody candidates within the project constraints.
