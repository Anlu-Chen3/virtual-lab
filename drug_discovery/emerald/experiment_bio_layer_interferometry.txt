ExperimentBioLayerInterferometry[Samples]‚üπProtocol
generates a Protocol object for performing Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) on the provided Samples.

Biolayer interferometry is a technique used to quantify the magnitude and kinetics of an interaction between a surface immobilized species and a solution phase analyte. Binding of the analyte is monitored by the change in thickness of the bound bio-layer on the tip of a fiber-optic probe, which is determined by the white-light interference pattern of a reference channel and the bio-layer/solution interface. Probe tips can be functionalized via immersion in a solution of the target immobilized species and regenerated to return either a loading ready or measurement ready surface. After appropriate treatment, the probes are dipped into a sample solution to quantify the analyte concentration or to determine the association and dissociation kinetics. Other common experiments include epitope binning and assay optimization. Biolayer interferometry is useful for studying a variety of interactions involving proteins, oligomers, small molecules, fragments, and antibodies, and can be performed on crude samples such as cell lysate.

Experimental Principles
Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a Biolayer Interferometry experiment. Step 1: The assay plate is loaded with buffers, loading solutions, standards, analytes, and other types of solutions required for the desired assay. Step 2: The probes are loaded into the probe rack position, where they may be immersed in equilibration solution prior to and during the course of the assay. Step 3: The multi-channel reader probes are immersed in an assay plate column to load the probe surface with an immobilized species (ActivateSurface, LoadSurface, Quench), measure the analyte binding properties (MeasureAssociation, MeasureDissocaition, Quantitate), or return the probe to measurement-ready condition via regeneration (Regenerate, Neutralize, Wash). Step 4: Any solutions derived from a given sample can be recovered from the AssayPlate.

Instrumentation
Octet Red96e
Model[Instrument, BioLayerInterferometer, "id:xRO9n3Bw9ZRq"]
Figure 2.1.1: Fiber-optic probes are stored in the probe rack position, either dry or immersed in a buffer solution. An 8-channel manifold moves between the probe rack and assay plate positions to pick up probes and conduct measurements via immersion in wells of a given column in the assay plate. A plate cover can be used to cover columns of the assay plate not currently being measured by the 8-channel reader to prevent evaporation over the course of long assays. The white light input reflects off of the internal optical layer and the biolayer/solution interface, producing an interference pattern which is directly proportional to the biolayer thickness.

Possible Issues
Sample evaporation
Assays longer than 4 hours may exhibit excessive evaporation which can impact experimental results. In this case, it is recommended that a plate cover be used to limit evaporation.
Insufficient well volume
Well volumes below 200 uL may result in sensor failure or inaccurate data due to incomplete probe immersion. Evaporation can be prevented by using the AssayPlateCover option.
Insufficient probe hydration
Probes should be immersed in buffer solution for at least 10 minutes prior to the assay beginning. Insufficient probe equilibration can lead to sensor failure. The use of the ProbeRackEquilibration option is highly recommended and will generally prevent this issue.
Baseline drift
The data may drift over time. This may be a result of incomplete probe equilibration.
Nonspecific binding
Nonspecific binding may occur in cases where the surface is not properly passivated or a suboptimal buffer is selected. The suggested remedy is to screen buffers or quench solutions to find a suitable solution.
Overloaded probe surface
Over-saturation of the probe surface may lead to overcrowding of the probe surface and misleading kinetic data. If probe surface saturation appears problematic, as indicated by abnormal association and dissociation curves, try loading for a shorter period of time or in a more dilute solution.
