ExperimentFluorescencePolarization[Samples]⟹Protocol
generates a Protocol for measuring fluorescence polarization of the provided Samples.

Fluorescence Polarization (FP) assesses the fraction of tracer bound to receptor by measuring the the molecular rotation of a fluorophore. The principle of FP is that a fluorophore excited by polarized light emits light oriented in a parallel plane. After a fluorescent molecule absorbs excitation light, it tumbles and rotates in solution during the time between excitation and emission. If the molecule is large, it rotates slowly, and the emission light remains largely polarized. Whereas a small, rapidly tumbling molecule rotates quickly and emits depolarized light. Measuring the degree of polarization provides a measure of the fraction of tracer bound to receptor, with applications in receptor-ligand binding, enzymatic degradation, and DNA hybridization studies.

Experimental Principles
Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a Fluorescence Polarization experiment. Step 1: Samples are prepared in a reader-compatible shallow well plate. Step 2: Injection lines are cleaned and primed. Step 3: The assay plate is optionally held at a specified temperature. Step 4: Injection samples are dispensed into the assay plate. Step 5: The assay plate is shaken. Step 6: The plate reader excites samples with horizontally polarized light and measures emitted light in the horizontal and vertical planes. Large molecules rotate slower than small molecules and reflect more polarized light. Step 7: Optionally follow-up analysis, such as standard curve fitting, can be performed.

Instrumentation
PHERAstar FS
Model[Instrument, PlateReader, id:01G6nvkKr3o7]
Figure 2.1.1: The PHERAstar uses optic modules to package excitation and emission filters into a single package. This means wavelength combinations are restricted to those which already exist in the optic module. Up to five excitation/emission pairs can be recorded in a single experiment. Additionally, the PHERAstar supports dual emission so it's possible to record emission data at 2 different wavelengths simultaneously. The plate chamber can be heated up to 45°C and it can mix the plate at up to 700 RPM before and/or during the run. The reader has two 300μL syringe pump injectors which can be used for 0.5 - 300 μL injections of two unique samples at up to four time points during the run. There are two primary kinetics read modes. It can perform all readings, injections and mixing for a single well before moving onto the next well or it can read in cycles, reading all the assay wells in the plate again and again until the RunTime has been reached. The second mode is recommended for most assays, except those that use very fast kinetics.

Example Calls
Excitation and Emission Wavelengths
Select a single excitation wavelength to excite the sample and one wavelength at which emitted light should be read:
ExperimentFluorescencePolarization[mySamples,
 	ExcitationWavelength -> (485 * Nanometer),
 	EmissionWavelength -> (520 * Nanometer)
 ]
Plate Reader Mixing
The assay plate can be mixed during readings by specifying any of the PlateReaderMix options:
ExperimentFluorescencePolarization[mySamples,
 	PlateReaderMix -> True,
 	PlateReaderMixTime -> (1 * Minute),
 	PlateReaderMixRate -> (700 * RPM)
 ]
Gain Setting
Gain can be set as a percentage of the maximum signal the reader can record:
ExperimentFluorescencePolarization[mySamples,
 PrimaryGain -> (50 * Percent)]
Alternatively directly specify the voltage to apply to the PMT. This is generally more helpful in repeat experiments. The gain can be taken from Object[Data, FluorescencePolarization][Gains]
ExperimentFluorescencePolarization[mySamples,
 PrimaryGain -> (2500 * Microvolt)]

Preferred Input Containers
The plate readers can read standard SBS shallow well plates.
The plate readers can inject samples from samples from 2mL, 15mL and 50 mL tubes while recording kinetic signal.

Possible Issues
Evaporation
During long runs evaporation can cause signal drift over time. Additionally using a high NumberOfReadings can lead to an initial hump while the PMT heats up.
Slow Injections
If the injection speed is not sufficient mixing may be inadequate.
Variable Detection Interval
The detection interval is determined by the instrument at run time. It depends on the number of wells being read, mixing parameters, the number of multichromatics, and the NumberOfReadings.
