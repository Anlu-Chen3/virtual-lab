However, these targets have a few potential issues. First, some targets (including GLP-1R) require binding to the transmembrane domain of the protein, but working with membrane-bound proteins at ECL is challenging. It is preferable to work with soluble proteins or exclusively the extracellular domain of transmembrane proteins. Second, some targets (including MurA/B) are intracellular, but peptides are generally not cell-permeable. Therefore, it is preferable to work with extracellular proteins or proteins that are accessible from the extracellular space. Third, some targets (including Amyloid-beta) require breaking up oligomers or fibrils, but this is hard to measure using the binding assays at ECL. Given these considerations, please reconsider your choice of targets for peptide-based drug design. You may keep any targets and/or add any new targets, with the goal of selecting the best possible set of five diseases/targets for the project.\"\n",
