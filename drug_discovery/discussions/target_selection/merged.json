Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.\n\nAs a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning for drug discovery. Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously suggested five possible disease/target pairs to develop a therapy for using peptide-based therapeutics. However, these targets have a few potential issues. First, some targets (including GLP-1R) require binding to the transmembrane domain of the protein, but working with membrane-bound proteins at ECL is challenging. It is preferable to work with soluble proteins or exclusively the extracellular domain of transmembrane proteins. Second, some targets (including MurA/B) are intracellular, but peptides are generally not cell-permeable. Therefore, it is preferable to work with extracellular proteins or proteins that are accessible from the extracellular space. Third, some targets (including Amyloid-beta) require breaking up oligomers or fibrils, but this is hard to measure using the binding assays at ECL. Given these considerations, please reconsider your choice of targets for peptide-based drug design. You may keep any targets and/or add any new targets, with the goal of selecting the best possible set of five diseases/targets for the project.\n\nAs a reference, here are the agenda questions from those meetings, which must be answered here as well:\n\n1. What five disease/target pairs are you now proposing to treat with peptides?\n\n2. Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for peptide-based therapeutics?\n\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."
