To address these, we will incorporate chemical modifications such as cyclization and non-natural amino acids, which can be systematically tested using ECL's capabilities. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity, stability, and specificity metrics, which will guide the optimization process. Contingency plans include adjusting peptide designs based on initial assay results and employing alternative assay formats if necessary. Rigorous control experiments and statistical analyses will ensure the reliability and reproducibility of our results.\n\nBy incorporating these improvements, we aim to enhance the clarity and detail of our project plan, ensuring alignment with the agenda and maximizing the scientific impact of our work."
