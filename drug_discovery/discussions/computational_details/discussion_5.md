4. **Self-Conditioning**: RFdiffusion employs a self-conditioning strategy, allowing it to condition on previous predictions, which improves the coherence and accuracy of the generated structures.

### Application to Designing Peptide Binders

1. **Binder Design**: RFdiffusion can be used to design peptide binders by conditioning the model on specific binding targets. This involves specifying interface hotspot residues on the target protein, guiding the model to generate binders that interact with these sites.

2. **Symmetric and Functional Motif Scaffolding**: The model can scaffold functional motifs, holding them in precise 3D geometries necessary for binding. This is particularly useful for designing peptide binders that need to engage specific protein interfaces.

3. **Experimental Validation**: The designed binders can be experimentally validated using techniques like cryo-electron microscopy to confirm their structure and binding efficacy. RFdiffusion has demonstrated success in designing binders with high affinity and specificity, which can be crucial for therapeutic applications.
