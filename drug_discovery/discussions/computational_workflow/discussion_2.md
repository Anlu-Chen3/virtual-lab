## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you for the perspectives shared so far. As the Scientific Critic, my role is to ensure that the proposed plan is scientifically rigorous and addresses potential pitfalls. Here are my critical observations and suggestions:

1. **Workflow Integration:** While the sequential approach is logical, I advise caution in assuming a linear progression without considering potential feedback loops at each stage. Each tool could potentially inform adjustments to earlier steps, especially if initial outcomes deviate from expectations. This will require robust data management and communication channels to ensure any insights are effectively looped back for quick iterations.

2. **Role of Each Tool:**
   - **RFDiffusion:** The idea of using this tool for backbone generation is sound, but we must be prepared for situations where the generated structures do not meet stability or functional requirements. A contingency plan should be in place to address such scenarios, possibly involving alternative generative models or parameters.
   - **ProteinMPNN:** While its sequence optimization capabilities are promising, reliance solely on predicted stability and binding may overlook practical synthesis challenges. We must incorporate real-world synthesis constraints as early as possible in the modeling phase.
   - **AlphaFold2:** Although its structural predictions are highly accurate, we need to ensure that the model's confidence scores (such as pLDDT) align with our expectations for functional activity. Structures with low confidence should be flagged for additional scrutiny or alternative design approaches.

3. **Input Data Requirements:** 
   - Each tool's input data should be rigorously vetted for quality and relevance. For instance, ensuring the MSAs fed into AlphaFold2 are not only recent but also comprehensive enough to capture functional nuances of target proteins.
   - We must also consider the potential biases in training datasets and actively work to mitigate these to avoid skewed predictions that might hamper therapeutic efficacy.

4. **Expected Outputs and Experimental Validation:**
   - The expectation for **RFDiffusion** to generate diverse structures should be tempered with an evaluation framework that can quickly identify the most promising candidates based on predefined criteria, such as ease of modification or synthesis potential.
   - **ProteinMPNN** outputs should be regularly cross-checked against experimental proteomics data to validate predicted sequences' real-world stability and function.
   - **AlphaFold2** verification should be complemented by alternative structural validation methods, such as docking simulations, to ensure robustness in binding predictions.

In summary, while the proposed strategy is comprehensive, it requires stringent validation and a flexible, adaptive approach to address potential hurdles. Ensuring robust feedback mechanisms and contingency plans will be key to the project's success. I look forward to how these considerations can be incorporated into the team's workflow to enhance scientific robustness and feasibility.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you for the synthesis, Principal Investigator. I appreciate the opportunity to address the follow-up questions and add to the discussion.

1. **Defining Criteria for Synthetic Accessibility and Stability:**
   - **Synthetic Accessibility:** We should prioritize backbones and sequences that are not only novel but also have a realistic path to synthesis. This includes assessing the length of the peptide, potential for post-translational modifications, and the presence of non-standard amino acids that could complicate synthesis.
   - **Stability:** In terms of stability, our criteria should focus on resistance to proteolytic degradation and maintaining structural integrity under physiological conditions. For this, we might consider incorporating known stabilization techniques such as cyclization or incorporating D-amino acids into the sequence during the design phase.

2. **Collaborative Approach:** I propose that the Medicinal Chemist and I work together to create a checklist or scoring system that evaluates these criteria for each proposed design. This system will be integrated into the workflow after RFDiffusion generates the backbones and before ProteinMPNN performs sequence optimization.

3. **Feedback Mechanism:** Iterative feedback will be crucial. We should use experimental data from ECL to continuously refine our models. For instance, if a particular sequence synthesizes well and shows promising initial results, we can analyze its features to inform subsequent design iterations.

In conclusion, aligning our design process with these synthetic and stability considerations will help streamline the transition from computational predictions to practical applications. I look forward to collaborating with the Medicinal Chemist on this and welcome any further insights from the team.

## Medicinal Chemist

Thank you, Principal Investigator and Computational Biologist, for your thoughtful synthesis and additions. I am in agreement with the approach outlined for incorporating synthetic accessibility and stability into our workflow. Here are my additional thoughts and contributions:

1. **Synthetic Accessibility:**
   - **Checklist Development:** I fully support the creation of a checklist or scoring system. This should include parameters such as peptide length, presence of reactive side chains, and the overall hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the peptide, which can affect solubility and purification processes.
   - **Chemical Modifications:** We should also consider the feasibility of introducing chemical modifications that enhance stability or target specificity, such as PEGylation or the addition of lipid anchors for membrane-associated targets.

2. **Stability Considerations:**
   - **Proteolytic Resistance:** In line with the Computational Biologist's suggestions, incorporating non-natural amino acids like D-amino acids or N-methylated residues can significantly enhance proteolytic stability. Additionally, we should consider designing cyclic peptides where possible, as they often show improved stability and bioavailability.

3. **Collaborative Evaluation:** I am keen to work closely with the Computational Biologist on integrating these factors into our design process. By using this scoring system early in the workflow, we can filter out designs that are unlikely to be successful in the lab, saving both time and resources.

4. **Iterative Feedback:** Implementing a feedback loop based on experimental outcomes will be essential. For instance, if a particular modification consistently improves stability in assays, we should integrate this learning back into our design parameters for future iterations.

Overall, these efforts should ensure that our peptide designs are not only computationally promising but also practically viable. I look forward to refining these criteria and integrating them into our workflow, and I am eager to hear additional insights from the Machine Learning Specialist and Scientific Critic.
