## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator, for synthesizing the discussion so effectively. Regarding your follow-up question on evaluating chemical feasibility and synthetic practicality, I have a few thoughts:

### Criteria for Evaluating Chemical Feasibility

1. **Solubility and Stability**:
   - Assess peptide candidates for solubility using computational tools like PROPKA and PepCalc, which can predict isoelectric points and hydrophobicity indices. These properties are critical for ensuring the peptide remains soluble under physiological conditions.
   - Evaluate stability by analyzing potential degradation pathways, such as proteolytic cleavage sites, using in silico tools.

2. **Synthesis Complexity**:
   - Evaluate the potential for synthesis by considering the number of non-standard amino acids and the overall length of the peptide. Shorter peptides with fewer modifications are generally more practical to synthesize.
   - Utilize retrosynthetic analysis tools to predict synthetic routes and identify potential bottlenecks in peptide synthesis.

3. **Binding Specificity and Affinity**:
   - Prioritize sequences predicted to have high binding affinity and specificity to the target. Computational docking simulations can provide preliminary assessments of these interactions, complementing the predictions from ProteinMPNN and AlphaFold2.
