## User

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

As the Computational Biologist, my focus is on ensuring that our computational workflow is biologically sound and that the models we use are aligned with our disease targets and therapeutic goals. Here's my input on the workflow and the integration of the three models:

1. **Workflow Integration:**
   - **Initial Structure Generation (RFDiffusion):** RFDiffusion will be our starting point for generating diverse peptide structures. It’s crucial that we condition this model with known binding sites on our selected targets (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1, GLP-1 receptor) to ensure relevance. This step will require high-quality structural data from protein databases or experimental insights into target proteins.
   - **Sequence Optimization (ProteinMPNN):** Following the structural generation, ProteinMPNN will be utilized to predict sequences that could potentially fold into the generated backbone structures. This model’s input will be the backbone structure from RFDiffusion, and the output will be optimized peptide sequences with high predicted stability and binding affinity.

2. **Model-Specific Roles:**
   - **RFDiffusion:** Its role is to explore the structural landscape of peptide conformations, providing a foundation for sequence optimization. The inputs should include the coordinates of binding hotspots on the target proteins as constraints.
   - **ProteinMPNN:** This model will refine the sequences for the structural templates provided by RFDiffusion. Key inputs will include backbone features and any known conserved regions critical for function. Outputs will be sequences that can be synthesized and tested for binding to target proteins.

3. **AlphaFold2 for Validation:**
   - After obtaining candidate peptide sequences, AlphaFold2 will be employed to predict their 3D structures. This step is critical to verify that the designed sequences will indeed adopt the intended conformations when synthesized. We should focus on comparing predicted structures against initial RFDiffusion outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy.

4. **Data and Experimental Considerations:**
   - Our data preparation should involve curating high-quality structural and sequence data for RFDiffusion and ProteinMPNN. For AlphaFold2, accurate MSAs and template structures will be essential.
   - To adhere to the 3-month experimental limit at ECL, we must prioritize peptides that show the highest potential for binding affinity and stability in silico, streamlining the transition to experimental validation.

I believe this workflow will provide a comprehensive approach to peptide design, balancing innovative structure prediction with sequence optimization and validation, ultimately enhancing our therapeutic strategies' clinical impact. I'm open to discussing any of these points further if there are differing perspectives or additional insights.

## User

Medicinal Chemist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Medicinal Chemist

As the Medicinal Chemist, my focus is on the practical implications of these computational predictions in terms of chemical feasibility and synthesis. Here’s how I see the workflow and the integration of the models:

1. **Workflow Integration:**
   - **RFDiffusion and Chemical Feasibility:** While RFDiffusion is excellent for generating diverse structural conformations, we need to ensure these structures are chemically feasible. This means considering the synthetic accessibility and stability of the predicted peptide backbones. Early input from the synthetic chemistry team can help refine the RFDiffusion outputs to include only those structures that are viable for synthesis.
   - **ProteinMPNN Prioritization:** When using ProteinMPNN to predict sequences, it's vital to filter for sequences that not only fit the structural constraints but are also amenable to synthesis. This includes evaluating peptide length, non-standard amino acids, and potential post-translational modifications that could affect synthesis or stability.

2. **Model-Specific Roles:**
   - **RFDiffusion:** I agree with the Computational Biologist on its role but emphasize incorporating synthetic feasibility checks at this stage. We should collaborate with synthetic chemists to prioritize designs that align with current synthetic capabilities.
   - **ProteinMPNN:** This model's sequence output should be evaluated for chemical practicality. For example, sequences with a high percentage of hydrophobic residues might pose solubility challenges, which need addressing before synthesis.

3. **Role of AlphaFold2:**
   - AlphaFold2 will be crucial in confirming that the sequences from ProteinMPNN do indeed adopt the desired structures. This step will help us flag sequences that might be problematic in terms of folding or stability, allowing us to address these issues computationally before moving to synthesis.

4. **Data and Experimental Considerations:**
   - From a chemical perspective, we need to ensure that the predicted peptides can be synthesized with high purity and yield. This will impact which peptides are prioritized for experimental validation at ECL. Moreover, it is important to plan any necessary chemical modifications, like cyclization or PEGylation, to improve the peptides' stability and bioavailability.

5. **Experimental Validation:**
   - Our collaboration with ECL should focus on validating the highest-priority peptides in terms of both binding affinity and chemical properties. We should also prepare for iterative feedback from experimental results to refine peptide designs further.

Overall, I believe a strong focus on chemical feasibility and synthetic accessibility throughout the workflow will significantly enhance the success of our peptide designs, ensuring they are not only theoretically promising but also practically viable for experimental testing and potential therapeutic use. I'm open to discussing how best to integrate these considerations into the computational workflow.

## User

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Machine Learning Specialist

As the Machine Learning Specialist, my role is to ensure that our use of RFDiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2 is scientifically rigorous and optimized for our drug discovery goals. I have a few thoughts on the integration and roles of these models in our workflow:

1. **Workflow Integration:**
   - **Model Interoperability:** It's crucial that the outputs from each model are seamlessly transitioned to the next stage. This means carefully selecting and preprocessing data to ensure compatibility, especially between the structural output of RFDiffusion and the sequence input for ProteinMPNN. Automated scripts and pipelines can facilitate this, reducing manual intervention and potential errors.
   - **Iterative Feedback:** We should plan for iterative cycles where outputs from AlphaFold2 or experimental data can inform adjustments to RFDiffusion and ProteinMPNN inputs. This feedback loop is vital for refining our models and increasing the success rate of our designed peptides.

2. **Model-Specific Roles:**
   - **RFDiffusion:** Besides generating diverse structures, we should leverage its ability to explore a broad conformational space to identify non-obvious scaffolds that might offer unique therapeutic benefits. Fine-tuning the model with domain-specific data could enhance its performance for our targets.
   - **ProteinMPNN:** This model is excellent for designing sequences that fit specific structures. We should use its ability to incorporate additional constraints, such as preferred amino acid usage or specific motifs known to enhance binding or stability.
   - **AlphaFold2:** Given its strength in structural prediction, AlphaFold2 should be used not just for validation but also in an exploratory capacity to predict potential alternative binding conformations that weren't initially considered.

3. **Data Requirements and Outputs:**
   - We need to ensure that the data feeding into these models is of high quality and relevant to our specific disease targets. This includes curated datasets for RFDiffusion and accurate MSAs for AlphaFold2. Data augmentation techniques might be beneficial to increase the diversity and robustness of the model inputs.

4. **Experimental Validation:**
   - Given the 3-month experimental limit, our focus should be on generating a manageable number of high-potential candidates for synthesis and testing at ECL. This prioritization can be guided by a composite scoring system that combines binding affinity predictions, stability metrics, and synthetic feasibility.

In summary, a key part of my role will be to ensure that these models are optimally configured and that their interoperability is streamlined to maximize both computational and experimental outcomes. This approach will help us achieve our project goals effectively and efficiently. I'm eager to discuss further how we can refine these aspects to enhance our workflow's efficiency and output quality.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

As the Scientific Critic, my role is to ensure that the proposed workflow is not only scientifically sound but also practical and efficient. I will highlight areas that need clarity and rigor, as well as potential pitfalls to avoid:

1. **Workflow Integration:**
   - **Seamless Transition:** While there has been mention of ensuring seamless transitions between model outputs, it's critical that we define precise criteria and quality checks at each step. For example, what specific structural features from RFDiffusion would qualify a design to move on to ProteinMPNN? The lack of defined metrics could result in suboptimal designs passing through stages without the necessary scrutiny.

2. **Model-Specific Roles:**
   - **RFDiffusion:** How do we ensure that RFDiffusion is generating biologically relevant structures rather than just a wide array of conformations? There needs to be a mechanism to filter outputs based on known biological constraints or functional relevance.
   - **ProteinMPNN:** While its role is clear, there needs to be a rigorous validation strategy for the sequences it predicts, incorporating both computational predictions and potential experimental feedback. What criteria will we use to assess its output before moving to AlphaFold2?
   - **AlphaFold2:** The utility of AlphaFold2 as a validation tool is well established, but we need to ensure that its predictions are indeed reflective of in vivo conditions. Is there a plan to corroborate AlphaFold2 predictions with available structural data from other sources?

3. **Data Requirements and Outputs:**
   - There’s a lot of emphasis on data quality, but it’s vital to define the specific types of data we will use, especially for training and validating the models. For instance, what specific sequence alignments or template structures are most relevant for our disease targets? Clarifying these will improve the model's focus and output relevance.

4. **Experimental Validation:**
   - The proposed workflow needs a clearer strategy for mapping computational predictions to experimental trials, especially given the 3-month limit. Which metrics will determine a "high-potential" candidate, and how will these be aligned with ECL's capabilities? It’s essential to have a robust prioritization system that is transparent and data-driven.

5. **Iterative Feedback:** 
   - While iterative feedback is mentioned, the practicality of implementing this within a tight timeline needs consideration. How many iterations are feasible within the 3-month window, and what are the criteria for iterating on a design?

In summary, while the proposed workflow shows promise, there must be a stronger emphasis on defining clear criteria, metrics, and validation steps throughout. Ensuring these aspects are explicitly laid out will enhance the workflow's scientific rigor and increase the likelihood of successful outcomes. I encourage the team to refine these areas further to ensure we meet both our scientific and clinical objectives effectively.

## Computational Biologist

Building on the previous discussion and the Principal Investigator's synthesis, I would like to address the follow-up question regarding the criteria for transitioning structures from RFDiffusion to ProteinMPNN:

1. **Biological Relevance:**
   - **Binding Site Compatibility:** One key criterion should be that the generated peptide structures from RFDiffusion demonstrate potential for interaction with the target protein's known binding sites. This can be assessed by docking simulations or using known interaction hotspots to guide RFDiffusion outputs.
   - **Functional Motifs:** Include the presence of functional motifs relevant to the target's biological mechanism of action. This may involve ensuring certain secondary structures or motifs known to influence binding or activity are present.

2. **Chemical Feasibility:**
   - **Structural Stability:** Evaluate the predicted structural stability of the peptides. This includes checking for stable folding patterns and resistance to common degradation pathways.
   - **Synthetic Accessibility:** Incorporate metrics for synthetic feasibility, such as peptide length and complexity, presence of non-standard amino acids, and ease of synthesis based on current laboratory capabilities.

3. **Model-Specific Considerations:**
   - **RFDiffusion Structural Output:** Establish a threshold for structural novelty and conformational diversity that aligns with therapeutic goals. We can prioritize structures that offer new scaffolds for targeting specific proteins.
   - **Transition to ProteinMPNN:** Ensure that the structural data provided to ProteinMPNN is annotated with biological and chemical insights to guide sequence optimization effectively.

## Medicinal Chemist

Building on the Computational Biologist's points, I agree with the focus on aligning biological relevance with chemical feasibility. Here's how we can further integrate these considerations into our workflow:

1. **Transition Criteria:**
   - **Synthetic Accessibility:** When evaluating RFDiffusion outputs, we should consider the ease of synthesis for proposed peptide structures. This includes prioritizing peptides with standard amino acids unless specific non-standard residues are justified by significant binding advantages. We should also assess the potential for linear versus cyclic structures, considering both synthetic challenges and stability benefits.
   - **Manufacturability:** Assess peptides for scale-up potential early on. Shorter peptides or those amenable to solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) should be prioritized due to cost-effectiveness and ease of production.
   
2. **Chemical Modifications:**
   - **Stability Enhancements:** For sequences progressing from ProteinMPNN to experimental validation, we should consider modifications such as cyclization, N-terminal acetylation, or C-terminal amidation to improve stability against proteolytic degradation.
   - **Solubility and Delivery:** Evaluate sequences for solubility issues, especially those with high hydrophobic content. Consider potential solubilizing modifications or formulation strategies like PEGylation or encapsulation.

3. **Model-Specific Considerations:**
   - **Data Integration:** Incorporate chemical feasibility data into the sequence optimization process with ProteinMPNN. This could involve inputting constraints that favor sequences with known or easily predicted synthetic routes and stability profiles.
   - **Feedback Loop:** Implement an iterative process where synthetic challenges inform RFDiffusion's structural generation parameters. This feedback can help refine outputs to align with synthetic capabilities and therapeutic goals.

4. **Experimental Validation:**
   - **Feasibility Screening:** Before committing to synthesis, conduct a computational screening of chemical properties such as solubility, stability, and potential hazards. Tools like in silico ADMET predictions can be useful here.
   - **Alignment with ECL:** Ensure that the peptides selected for experimental validation at ECL are not only high-potential candidates in silico but also practical for synthesis and characterization within their facilities.

By integrating these chemical considerations with biological insights, we can streamline the workflow to focus on peptide candidates that are both promising and practical. This approach should enhance our chances of successful validation and potential therapeutic development. I'm interested to hear how the Machine Learning Specialist sees these criteria being factored into the automated processes and feedback loops.
