Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Please read the summaries of multiple separate meetings about the same agenda. Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.

As a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning for drug discovery. Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. Now you need to design an experimental protocol for evaluating peptides for their ability to bind to a target protein. Please write a precise protocol for synthesizing peptides and testing their binding to a target protein. You must exclusively use ECL for all experimental validation. In your protocol, name the specific ECL experiments that will be performed and the expected results for each experiment. Additionally, list all reagents that will be needed for each ECL experiment along with the required quantities. Make sure the protocol is as detailed as possible. Include controls and replicates where necessary.



Medicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda.
