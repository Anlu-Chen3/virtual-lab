There are many forms of ELISA, such as direct ELISA, indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA, competitive ELISA, and fast ELISA that apply antigens and antibodies in varied sequences. During an ELISA experiment, protein standards and samples are loaded onto ELISA plates and the target antigen is bound by antibodies. Antigen concentration is revealed by an enzyme, which converts its substrate into a colored product. Results are measured using colorimetric detection, and antigen concentrations are calculated using the standard curve generated from protein standards.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Overview of ELISA methods. In a DirectELISA experiment, the Sample is coated on the ELISAPlate, and then a primary antibody is used to detect the target antigen. In a DirectSandwichELISA experiment, a capture antibody is coated onto the ELISAPlate to pull down the target antigen from the sample. Then primary antibody is used to detect the target antigen. In a DirectCompetitiveELISA experiment, a reference antigen is used to coat the ELISAPlate. Samples are incubated with the primary antibody. Then, when the Sample-Antibody-Complex solution is loaded on the ELISAPlate, the remaining free primary antibody binds to the reference antigen. In a FastELISA experiment, a coating antibody against a tag is coated to the ELISAPlate. A capture antibody containing this small tag and a primary antibody for antigen detection is incubated with the sample to form a CaptureAntibody-TargetAntigen-PrimaryAntibody complex. Then this complex is pulled down by the coating antibody to the surface of the plate. Compared with the Direct methods where the primary antibody is conjugated with an enzyme (such as Horse Radish Peroxidase/HRP or Alkaline Phosphatas/AP) for detection, in Indirect methods a secondary antibody is, instead, conjugated with this enzyme. During Indirect methods, an additional step of SecondaryAntibody incubation is added to the corresponding Direct methods.\n\nFigure 1.2: DirectELISA process: 1.

It is capable of processing plate operations including liquid handling with 4 indipendent pipettes, microplate movements, plate incubation-shaking, plate washing, and plate absorbance measurements.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nGeneral\n\nMethod\n\nDefines the type of ELISA experiment to be performed. Types include DirectELISA, IndirectELISA, DirectSandwichELISA, IndirectSandwichELISA, DirectCompetitiveELISA, IndirectCompetitiveELISA, and FastELISA. Compared with the Direct methods where the primary antibody is conjugated with an enzyme (such as Horse Radish Peroxidase/HRP or Alkaline Phosphatas/AP) for detection, in all Indirect methods a secondary antibody is, instead, conjugated with this enzyme. In Indirect methods, an additional step of SecondaryAntibody incubation is added to the corresponding Direct methods. In a DirectELISA experiment, the Sample is coated on the ELISAPlate, and then a primary antibody is used to detect the target antigen. In a DirectSandwichELISA experiment, a capture antibody is coated onto the ELISAPlate to pull down the target antigen from the sample. Then a primary antibody is used to detect the target antigen. In a DirectCompetitiveELISA experiment, a reference antigen is used to coat the ELISAPlate. Samples are incubated with the primary antibody. Then, when the Sample-Antibody-Complex solution is loaded on the ELISAPlate, the remaining free primary antibody binds to the reference antigen. In a FastELISA experiment, a coating antibody against a tag is coated to the ELISAPlate. A capture antibody containing this tag and a primary antibody for antigen detection is incubated with the sample to form a CaptureAntibody-TargetAntigen-PrimaryAntibody complex. Then this complex is pulled down by the coating antibody to the surface of the plate (See Figure 1.1).\n\nDefault Value: DirectELISA\n\nPattern Description: DirectELISA, IndirectELISA, DirectSandwichELISA, IndirectSandwichELISA, DirectCompetitiveELISA, IndirectCompetitiveELISA, or FastELISA.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: ELISAMethodP\n\nTargetAntigen\n\nThe Analyte molecule (e.g., peptide, protein, and hormone) detected and quantified in the samples by Antibodies in the ELISA experiment. This option is used to automatically set sample Antibodies and the corresponding experiment conditions of Standards and Blanks.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to the Model[Molecule] in the Analyte field of the sample.\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Molecule] or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (ObjectP[{Model[Molecule]}] | Automatic) | Null\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nNumberOfReplicates\n\nThe number of times an ELISA assay will be repeated in parallel wells. Samples, Standards, or Blanks will be loaded this number of times in the plates. Replications are conducted at the same time, and if possible, in the same ELISAPlate. If set to Null, each Sample, Standard, or Blank will be assayed once.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to 2 unless method is DirectELISA or IndirectELISA and Coating is False, in which case it is set to Null.\n\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 192 in increments of 1 or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (RangeP[2, 192, 1] | Automatic) | Null\n\nWashingBuffer\n\nThe solution used to rinse off unbound molecules from the assay plate.\n\nDefault Value: Model[Sample, StockSolution, Phosphate Buffered Saline with 0.05% TWEEN 20, pH 7.4]\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Sample] or Object[Sample] or a prepared sample.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: ObjectP[{Model[Sample], Object[Sample]}] | _String\n\nSample Assembly\n\nSpike\n\nThe sample with a known concentration of analyte. Spike is to be mixed with the input sample. The purpose of spiking is to perform a spike-and-recovery assessment to determine whether the ELISA can accurately test the concentration of analyte within the context of the sample. If the recovery observed for the spiked sample is identical to the analyte prepared in standard diluent, the sample is considered not to interfere with the assay. For example, if molecules in the sample inhibits the binding between the antibody and TargetAntigen, the results from the ELISA becomes inaccurate. In a Spike-and-Recovery experiment,an aliquot of a sample is mixed with Spike. ELISA is performed on the Sample alone (also called Neat Sample) and the Spiked Sample at the same time, where the Spike concentration in the sample can be measured. This measured Spike concentration can be then compared with the known Spike concentration. Typically a 20% difference between measured Spike concentration and the known Spike concentration is acceptable. Spiked sample can be further diluted to perform linearity-of-dilution assessment. The plate used for sample spiking and dilution will be discarded after the experiment.\n\nDefault Value: Null\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Sample] or Object[Sample] or a prepared sample or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (ObjectP[{Model[Sample], Object[Sample]}] | _String) | Null\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nSpikeDilutionFactor\n\nThe dilution ratio by which the Spike is mixed with the input sample before further dilution is performed.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to 0.1 if Spike is not Null.\n\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1 or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (RangeP[0, 1] | Automatic) | Null\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nSpikeStorageCondition\n\nThe condition under which the unused portion of spike should be stored.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to Refrigerator if Spike is not Null.\n\nPattern Description: {AmbientStorage, Refrigerator, Freezer, DeepFreezer, CryogenicStorage, YeastIncubation, BacteriaIncubation, MammalianIncubation, TissueCultureCellsIncubation, MicrobialCellsIncubation, MicrobialCellsShakingIncubation, YeastCellsIncubation, YeastCellsShakingIncubation, ViralIncubation, AcceleratedTesting, IntermediateTesting, LongTermTesting, UVVisLightTesting} or Disposal or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: ((SampleStorageTypeP | Disposal) | Automatic) | Null\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nSampleSerialDilutionCurve\n\nThe collection of serial dilutions that will be performed on each sample: if spiking was performed, the dilution will be performed on the spiked sample; otherwise, the dilutions will be performed on the sample. This Linearity-of-Dilution step assesses whether the ELISA experiment can reliably measure TargetAntigen concentration at different concentration ranges. For example, a sample with TargetAntigen concentration of 100ng/ul, if diluted 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, should yield ELISA measurements of 50ng/ul, 25ng/ul, and 12.5ng/ul (or should follow a concentration ratio of 4:2:1). Typically a 20% difference between the measured and expected concentrations is considered acceptable. For Serial Dilution Volumes, the Transfer Volume is taken out of the sample and added to a second well with the Diluent Volume of the Diluent. It is mixed, then the Transfer Volume is taken out of that well to be added to a third well. This is repeated to make Number Of Dilutions diluted samples. For example, if a 100 ug/ ml sample with a Transfer Volume of 20 Microliters, a Diluent Volume of 60 Microliters and a Number of Dilutions of 3 is used, it will create a DilutionCurve of 25 ug/ ml, 6.25 ug/ ml, and 1.5625 ug/ ml with each dilution having a volume of 60 Microliters. For Serial Dilution Factors, the sample will be diluted by the dilution factor at each transfer step. IMPORTANT: because the dilution curve does not intrinsically include the original sample, in the case of sample dilution the first diluting factor should be 1 or Diluent Volume should be 0 Microliter to include the original sample. For example, if a Spike-and-Recovery assay is to be performed, the first dilution factor must be 1 in order to include the original spiked sample. During experiment, an 5% extra volume than specified is going to be prepared in order to offset pipetting errors. Therefore, the total volume for each well specified in this option should be equal or greater than the volume needed for the experiment. Because the dilution of each assay (well) is prepared independently, the Number of Replications should not be considered when determining the Spike Volume. The plate used for sample dilutions will be discarded after the experiment. Note: if spike or antibodies are to be mixed with samples, their volumes are counted towards diluent volume.\n\nFigure 3.1: Use the SerialDilutionCuve option to create a collection of serial dilutions that will be performed on samples.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: The option is automatically set Null if or a SampleDilutionCurve is specified.\n\nPattern Description: Serial Dilution Factor or Serial Dilution Volumes or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (({RangeP[10*Microliter, 1500*Milliliter], {RangeP[0, 1], GreaterP[0, 1]} | {RangeP[0, 1]..}} | {RangeP[0*Microliter, 1000*Microliter], RangeP[0*Microliter, 1000*Microliter], GreaterP[0, 1]}) | Automatic) | Null\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nSampleDilutionCurve\n\nThe collection of dilutions that will be performed on each sample: the dilutions will be performed on the sample. Spiked samples should only be further diluted with serial dilution. This Linearity-of-Dilution step assesses whether the ELISA experiment can reliably measure TargetAntigen concentration at different concentration ranges. For example, a sample with TargetAntigen concentration of 100ng/ul, if diluted 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, should yield ELISA measurements of 50ng/ul, 25ng/ul, and 12.5ng/ul (or should follow a concentration ratio of 8:4:2:1). Typically a 20% difference between the measured and expected concentrations is considered acceptable. Linearity-of-Dilution experiment can be done with Spiked or non-Spiked samples. For Fixed Dilution Volume Dilution Curves, the Spike Amount is the volume of the sample that will be mixed the Diluent Volume of the Diluent to create a desired concentration. The Assay Volume is the TOTAL volume of the sample that will be created after being diluted by the Dilution Factor. IMPORTANT: because the dilution curve does not intrinsically include the original sample, in the case of sample dilution the first diluting factor must be 1, or Diluent Volume should be 0 to include the original sample. During experiment, an 5% extra volume than specified is going to be prepared in order to offset pipetting errors. Therefore, the total volume for each well specified in this option should be equal or greater than the volume needed for the experiment. Because the dilution of each assay (well) is prepared independently, the Number of Replications should not be considered when determining the Spike Volume. The plate used for sample dilutions will be discarded after the experiment. Note: if spike or antibodies are to be mixed with samples, their volumes are counted towards diluent volume.\n\nFigure 3.2: Use the DilutionCuve option to create a collection of dilutions that will be performed on samples.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: The option is automatically set Null if or a SampleSerialDilutionCurve is specified.\n\nPattern Description: Fixed Dilution Factor or Fixed Dilution Volume or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (({{RangeP[10*Microliter, 1500*Microliter], RangeP[0, 1]}..} | {{RangeP[0*Microliter, 1000*Microliter], RangeP[0*Microliter, 1000*Microliter]}..}) | Automatic) | Null\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nSampleDiluent\n\nThe buffer used to perform multiple dilutions of samples or spiked samples.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: If SampleDilutionCurve and SampleSerialDilutionCurve are not both Null, in the case when Method is set to DirectELISA and IndirectELISA, the option is automatically set to Model[Sample, StockSolution, \"1x Carbonate-Bicarbonate Buffer pH10\"]; in all other cases, the option is automatically set to Model[Sample,\"ELISA Blocker Blocking Buffer\"].\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Sample] or Object[Sample] or a prepared sample or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: ((ObjectP[{Model[Sample], Object[Sample]}] | _String) | Automatic) | Null\n\nAntibody Antigen Preparation\n\nCoatingAntibody\n\nThe sample containing the antibody that is used for coating in FastELISA.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: If Method is FastELISA, automatically set to an antibody against a tag which is conjugated to a the CaptureAntibody.\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Sample] or Object[Sample] or a prepared sample or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: ((ObjectP[{Model[Sample], Object[Sample]}] | _String) | Automatic) | Null\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nCoatingAntibodyDilutionFactor\n\nThe dilution ratio of CoatingAntibody.

StandardLoadingVolume of each dilution will be transferred to the ELISAPlate. For Serial Dilution Volumes, the Transfer Volume is taken out of the sample and added to a second well with the Diluent Volume of the Diluent. It is mixed, then the Transfer Volume is taken out of that well to be added to a third well. This is repeated to make Number Of Dilutions diluted samples. For example, if a 100 ug/ ml sample with a Transfer Volume of 20 Microliters, a Diluent Volume of 60 Microliters and a Number of Dilutions of 3 is used, it will create a DilutionCurve of 25 ug/ ml, 6.25 ug/ ml, and 1.5625 ug/ ml with each dilution having a volume of 60 Microliters. For Serial Dilution Factors, the sample will be diluted by the dilution factor at each transfer step. IMPORTANT: because the dilution curve does not intrinsically include the original sample, if the original standard solution is to be included in the dilution curve, the first diluting factor should be set to 1 or Diluent Volume should be 0 Microliters. During experiment, an 5% extra volume than specified is going to be prepared in order to offset pipetting errors. Therefore, the total volume for each well specified in this option should be equal or greater than the volume needed for the experiment. Because the dilution of each assay (well) is prepared independently, the NumberOfReplications should not be considered when determining the Standard Volume. The plate used for sample dilutions will be discarded after the experiment. Note: if spike or antibodies are to be mixed with samples, their volumes are counted towards diluent volume.\n\nFigure 3.3: Use the SerialDilutionCuve option to create a collection of serial dilutions that will be performed on standards.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to Null if the StandardDilutionCurve is specified.

For Fixed Dilution Volume Dilution Curves, the Standard Amount is the volume of the sample that will be mixed the Diluent Volume of the Diluent to create a desired concentration. The Standard Volume is the TOTAL volume of the sample that will created after being diluted by the Dilution Factor. For example, a 1 ug/ ml sample with a dilution factor of 0.7 will be diluted to a concentration 0.7 ug/ ml. IMPORTANT: because the dilution curve does not intrinsically include the original sample, if the original standard solution is to be included in the dilution curve, the first diluting factor should be set to 1 or Diluent Volume must be 0 Microliter. During experiment, an 5% extra volume than specified is going to be prepared in order to offset pipetting errors. Therefore, the total volume for each well specified in this option should be equal or greater than the volume needed for the experiment.

Prolonged incubation at high temperature (such as 37 \u00b0C for 3 hours) may result in evaporation of samples. To reduce such effect, avoid long incubation of samples with very small volumes (such as under 50 Microliter) at a high temperature.\n\nUneven incubation time\n\nThe 4-channel pipette loads liquid into 4 wells at a time. When incubation time is short but number of wells is large, the time-difference between the loading of first and last wells may affect data. For this, we recommend incubation times to be longer than 30 minutes.\n\nSub-optimal Dilution\n\nDilutions of samples, standards, and antibodies should be empirically optimized for the best performance of the experiment. For example, if antibody is over dilute, the signal may be too weak to be detected.\n\nSub-optimal Diluent\n\nDiluent for samples, standards and antibodies should be empirically optimized for the best performance of the experiment. Form example, biocarbonate buffer at PH 10 may result in better coating than phosphate-buffered saline at PH 6.7.\n\nDetection reagent\n\nDetection reagent such as TMB with H2O2 may have a short shelf life. We recommend using stablized detection reagent that do not require fresh mixing immediately before experiment.\n\n[end context 1]\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\n### Revised Agenda Response\n\nIn response to the Scientific Critic's feedback, I have further refined our approach to ensure a comprehensive and detailed plan for our drug discovery project using machine learning.\n\n### Answers\n\n1. **What is the specific drug modality that you are proposing?**\n\n   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.\n\n   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation.

Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.\n\n4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.\n\n5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.\n\nBy incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.\n\n[end summary 1]\n\n[begin summary 2]\n\n### Revised Agenda Response\n\nOur project aims to leverage machine learning for drug discovery, focusing on peptide-based therapeutics.
