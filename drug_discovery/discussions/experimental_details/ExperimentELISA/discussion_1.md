ExperimentELISA[Samples]‚üπProtocol

creates a Protocol to run Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) experiment on the provided Samples for the detection and quantification of certain analytes.



Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) uses antigen-antibody interaction to quantitatively measure the concentration of an antigen in samples or compare antibody binding affinity. There are many forms of ELISA, such as direct ELISA, indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA, competitive ELISA, and fast ELISA that apply antigens and antibodies in varied sequences. During an ELISA experiment, protein standards and samples are loaded onto ELISA plates and the target antigen is bound by antibodies. Antigen concentration is revealed by an enzyme, which converts its substrate into a colored product. Results are measured using colorimetric detection, and antigen concentrations are calculated using the standard curve generated from protein standards.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Overview of ELISA methods. In a DirectELISA experiment, the Sample is coated on the ELISAPlate, and then a primary antibody is used to detect the target antigen. In a DirectSandwichELISA experiment, a capture antibody is coated onto the ELISAPlate to pull down the target antigen from the sample. Then primary antibody is used to detect the target antigen. In a DirectCompetitiveELISA experiment, a reference antigen is used to coat the ELISAPlate. Samples are incubated with the primary antibody. Then, when the Sample-Antibody-Complex solution is loaded on the ELISAPlate, the remaining free primary antibody binds to the reference antigen. In a FastELISA experiment, a coating antibody against a tag is coated to the ELISAPlate. A capture antibody containing this small tag and a primary antibody for antigen detection is incubated with the sample to form a CaptureAntibody-TargetAntigen-PrimaryAntibody complex. Then this complex is pulled down by the coating antibody to the surface of the plate. Compared with the Direct methods where the primary antibody is conjugated with an enzyme (such as Horse Radish Peroxidase/HRP or Alkaline Phosphatas/AP) for detection, in Indirect methods a secondary antibody is, instead, conjugated with this enzyme. During Indirect methods, an additional step of SecondaryAntibody incubation is added to the corresponding Direct methods.

Experiment Options

General

Method

Defines the type of ELISA experiment to be performed. Types include DirectELISA, IndirectELISA, DirectSandwichELISA, IndirectSandwichELISA, DirectCompetitiveELISA, IndirectCompetitiveELISA, and FastELISA. Compared with the Direct methods where the primary antibody is conjugated with an enzyme (such as Horse Radish Peroxidase/HRP or Alkaline Phosphatas/AP) for detection, in all Indirect methods a secondary antibody is, instead, conjugated with this enzyme. In Indirect methods, an additional step of SecondaryAntibody incubation is added to the corresponding Direct methods. In a DirectELISA experiment, the Sample is coated on the ELISAPlate, and then a primary antibody is used to detect the target antigen. In a DirectSandwichELISA experiment, a capture antibody is coated onto the ELISAPlate to pull down the target antigen from the sample. Then a primary antibody is used to detect the target antigen. In a DirectCompetitiveELISA experiment, a reference antigen is used to coat the ELISAPlate. Samples are incubated with the primary antibody. Then, when the Sample-Antibody-Complex solution is loaded on the ELISAPlate, the remaining free primary antibody binds to the reference antigen. In a FastELISA experiment, a coating antibody against a tag is coated to the ELISAPlate. A capture antibody containing this tag and a primary antibody for antigen detection is incubated with the sample to form a CaptureAntibody-TargetAntigen-PrimaryAntibody complex. Then this complex is pulled down by the coating antibody to the surface of the plate (See Figure 1.1).

Sample Assembly

Spike

The sample with a known concentration of analyte. Spike is to be mixed with the input sample. The purpose of spiking is to perform a spike-and-recovery assessment to determine whether the ELISA can accurately test the concentration of analyte within the context of the sample. If the recovery observed for the spiked sample is identical to the analyte prepared in standard diluent, the sample is considered not to interfere with the assay. For example, if molecules in the sample inhibits the binding between the antibody and TargetAntigen, the results from the ELISA becomes inaccurate. In a Spike-and-Recovery experiment,an aliquot of a sample is mixed with Spike. ELISA is performed on the Sample alone (also called Neat Sample) and the Spiked Sample at the same time, where the Spike concentration in the sample can be measured. This measured Spike concentration can be then compared with the known Spike concentration. Typically a 20% difference between measured Spike concentration and the known Spike concentration is acceptable. Spiked sample can be further diluted to perform linearity-of-dilution assessment. The plate used for sample spiking and dilution will be discarded after the experiment.

Default Value: Null

Pattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Sample] or Object[Sample] or a prepared sample or Null.

Programmatic Pattern: ((SampleStorageTypeP | Disposal) | Automatic) | Null

Index Matches to: experiment samples

SampleSerialDilutionCurve

The collection of serial dilutions that will be performed on each sample: if spiking was performed, the dilution will be performed on the spiked sample; otherwise, the dilutions will be performed on the sample. This Linearity-of-Dilution step assesses whether the ELISA experiment can reliably measure TargetAntigen concentration at different concentration ranges. For example, a sample with TargetAntigen concentration of 100ng/ul, if diluted 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, should yield ELISA measurements of 50ng/ul, 25ng/ul, and 12.5ng/ul (or should follow a concentration ratio of 4:2:1). Typically a 20% difference between the measured and expected concentrations is considered acceptable. For Serial Dilution Volumes, the Transfer Volume is taken out of the sample and added to a second well with the Diluent Volume of the Diluent. It is mixed, then the Transfer Volume is taken out of that well to be added to a third well. This is repeated to make Number Of Dilutions diluted samples. For example, if a 100 ug/ ml sample with a Transfer Volume of 20 Microliters, a Diluent Volume of 60 Microliters and a Number of Dilutions of 3 is used, it will create a DilutionCurve of 25 ug/ ml, 6.25 ug/ ml, and 1.5625 ug/ ml with each dilution having a volume of 60 Microliters. For Serial Dilution Factors, the sample will be diluted by the dilution factor at each transfer step. IMPORTANT: because the dilution curve does not intrinsically include the original sample, in the case of sample dilution the first diluting factor should be 1 or Diluent Volume should be 0 Microliter to include the original sample. For example, if a Spike-and-Recovery assay is to be performed, the first dilution factor must be 1 in order to include the original spiked sample. During experiment, an 5% extra volume than specified is going to be prepared in order to offset pipetting errors. Therefore, the total volume for each well specified in this option should be equal or greater than the volume needed for the experiment. Because the dilution of each assay (well) is prepared independently, the Number of Replications should not be considered when determining the Spike Volume. The plate used for sample dilutions will be discarded after the experiment. Note: if spike or antibodies are to be mixed with samples, their volumes are counted towards diluent volume.

Figure 3.1: Use the SerialDilutionCuve option to create a collection of serial dilutions that will be performed on samples.

Default Value: Automatic

Default Calculation: The option is automatically set Null if or a SampleDilutionCurve is specified.

Index Matches to: experiment samples

SampleDilutionCurve

The collection of dilutions that will be performed on each sample: the dilutions will be performed on the sample. Spiked samples should only be further diluted with serial dilution. This Linearity-of-Dilution step assesses whether the ELISA experiment can reliably measure TargetAntigen concentration at different concentration ranges. For example, a sample with TargetAntigen concentration of 100ng/ul, if diluted 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, should yield ELISA measurements of 50ng/ul, 25ng/ul, and 12.5ng/ul (or should follow a concentration ratio of 8:4:2:1). Typically a 20% difference between the measured and expected concentrations is considered acceptable. Linearity-of-Dilution experiment can be done with Spiked or non-Spiked samples. For Fixed Dilution Volume Dilution Curves, the Spike Amount is the volume of the sample that will be mixed the Diluent Volume of the Diluent to create a desired concentration. The Assay Volume is the TOTAL volume of the sample that will be created after being diluted by the Dilution Factor. IMPORTANT: because the dilution curve does not intrinsically include the original sample, in the case of sample dilution the first diluting factor must be 1, or Diluent Volume should be 0 to include the original sample. During experiment, an 5% extra volume than specified is going to be prepared in order to offset pipetting errors. Therefore, the total volume for each well specified in this option should be equal or greater than the volume needed for the experiment. Because the dilution of each assay (well) is prepared independently, the Number of Replications should not be considered when determining the Spike Volume. The plate used for sample dilutions will be discarded after the experiment. Note: if spike or antibodies are to be mixed with samples, their volumes are counted towards diluent volume.

StandardSerialDilutionCurve

The collection of serial dilutions that will be performed on sample. StandardLoadingVolume of each dilution will be transferred to the ELISAPlate. For Serial Dilution Volumes, the Transfer Volume is taken out of the sample and added to a second well with the Diluent Volume of the Diluent. It is mixed, then the Transfer Volume is taken out of that well to be added to a third well. This is repeated to make Number Of Dilutions diluted samples. For example, if a 100 ug/ ml sample with a Transfer Volume of 20 Microliters, a Diluent Volume of 60 Microliters and a Number of Dilutions of 3 is used, it will create a DilutionCurve of 25 ug/ ml, 6.25 ug/ ml, and 1.5625 ug/ ml with each dilution having a volume of 60 Microliters. For Serial Dilution Factors, the sample will be diluted by the dilution factor at each transfer step. IMPORTANT: because the dilution curve does not intrinsically include the original sample, if the original standard solution is to be included in the dilution curve, the first diluting factor should be set to 1 or Diluent Volume should be 0 Microliters. During experiment, an 5% extra volume than specified is going to be prepared in order to offset pipetting errors. Therefore, the total volume for each well specified in this option should be equal or greater than the volume needed for the experiment. Because the dilution of each assay (well) is prepared independently, the NumberOfReplications should not be considered when determining the Standard Volume. The plate used for sample dilutions will be discarded after the experiment. Note: if spike or antibodies are to be mixed with samples, their volumes are counted towards diluent volume.

For Fixed Dilution Volume Dilution Curves, the Standard Amount is the volume of the sample that will be mixed the Diluent Volume of the Diluent to create a desired concentration.

For example, a 1 ug/ ml sample with a dilution factor of 0.7 will be diluted to a concentration 0.7 ug/ ml. IMPORTANT: because the dilution curve does not intrinsically include the original sample, if the original standard solution is to be included in the dilution curve, the first diluting factor should be set to 1 or Diluent Volume must be 0 Microliter. During experiment, an 5% extra volume than specified is going to be prepared in order to offset pipetting errors. Therefore, the total volume for each well specified in this option should be equal or greater than the volume needed for the experiment. Because the dilution of each assay (well) is prepared independently, the NumberOfReplications should not be considered when determining the Standard Volume. The plate used for sample dilutions will be discarded after the experiment. Note: if spike or antibodies are to be mixed with samples, their volumes are counted towards diluent volume.

Preferred Input Containers

The experiment takes common liquid handler compatible containers.



Possible Issues

Evaporation during prolonged incubation

All incubations after ELISAPlate coating are performed in a plate incubator without plate seals. Prolonged incubation at high temperature (such as 37 ¬∞C for 3 hours) may result in evaporation of samples. To reduce such effect, avoid long incubation of samples with very small volumes (such as under 50 Microliter) at a high temperature.

Uneven incubation time

The 4-channel pipette loads liquid into 4 wells at a time. When incubation time is short but number of wells is large, the time-difference between the loading of first and last wells may affect data. For this, we recommend incubation times to be longer than 30 minutes.

Sub-optimal Dilution

Dilutions of samples, standards, and antibodies should be empirically optimized for the best performance of the experiment. For example, if antibody is over dilute, the signal may be too weak to be detected.

Sub-optimal Diluent

Diluent for samples, standards and antibodies should be empirically optimized for the best performance of the experiment. Form example, biocarbonate buffer at PH 10 may result in better coating than phosphate-buffered saline at PH 6.7.

Detection reagent

Detection reagent such as TMB with H2O2 may have a short shelf life. We recommend using stablized detection reagent that do not require fresh mixing immediately before experiment.

   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.

   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.

2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**

   **Answer**: 
   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor
   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1
   3. Alzheimer's Disease - Amyloid-beta
   4. Antimicrobial Resistance - MurA/B
   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9

   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.
