ExperimentFluorescencePolarization[Samples]⟹Protocol

generates a Protocol for measuring fluorescence polarization of the provided Samples.



Fluorescence Polarization (FP) assesses the fraction of tracer bound to receptor by measuring the the molecular rotation of a fluorophore. The principle of FP is that a fluorophore excited by polarized light emits light oriented in a parallel plane. After a fluorescent molecule absorbs excitation light, it tumbles and rotates in solution during the time between excitation and emission. If the molecule is large, it rotates slowly, and the emission light remains largely polarized. Whereas a small, rapidly tumbling molecule rotates quickly and emits depolarized light. Measuring the degree of polarization provides a measure of the fraction of tracer bound to receptor, with applications in receptor-ligand binding, enzymatic degradation, and DNA hybridization studies.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a Fluorescence Polarization experiment. Step 1: Samples are prepared in a reader-compatible shallow well plate. Step 2: Injection lines are cleaned and primed. Step 3: The assay plate is optionally held at a specified temperature. Step 4: Injection samples are dispensed into the assay plate. Step 5: The assay plate is shaken. Step 6: The plate reader excites samples with horizontally polarized light and measures emitted light in the horizontal and vertical planes. Large molecules rotate slower than small molecules and reflect more polarized light. Step 7: Optionally follow-up analysis, such as standard curve fitting, can be performed.



Instrumentation

PHERAstar FS

Model[Instrument, PlateReader, "id:01G6nvkKr3o7"]

Figure 2.1.1: The PHERAstar uses optic modules to package excitation and emission filters into a single package. This means wavelength combinations are restricted to those which already exist in the optic module. Up to five excitation/emission pairs can be recorded in a single experiment. Additionally, the PHERAstar supports dual emission so it's possible to record emission data at 2 different wavelengths simultaneously. The plate chamber can be heated up to 45°C and it can mix the plate at up to 700 RPM before and/or during the run. The reader has two 300μL syringe pump injectors which can be used for 0.5 - 300 μL injections of two unique samples at up to four time points during the run. There are two primary kinetics read modes. It can perform all readings, injections and mixing for a single well before moving onto the next well or it can read in cycles, reading all the assay wells in the plate again and again until the RunTime has been reached. The second mode is recommended for most assays, except those that use very fast kinetics.

   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.

   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.

2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**

   **Answer**: 
   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor
   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1
   3. Alzheimer's Disease - Amyloid-beta
   4. Antimicrobial Resistance - MurA/B
   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9

   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.
