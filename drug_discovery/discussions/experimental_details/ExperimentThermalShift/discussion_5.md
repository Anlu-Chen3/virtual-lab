ExperimentThermalShift[Samples]⟹Protocol

creates a Protocol object for measuring sample fluorescence during heating and cooling (melting curve analysis) to determine shifts in thermal stability of Samples under varying conditions.



ExperimentThermalShift quantifies alterations in molecular structure through changes in fluorescence emission across a temperature gradient. This assay utilizes either extrinsic fluorescent dyes or intrinsic fluorescence to monitor conformational changes in nucleic acids or proteins. Additionally, sample aggregate formation across a temperature gradient can be measured using static light scattering whereby larger molecules scatter more light. The data generated by this experiment can be used to determine the samples’ melting point or aggregation point which is characteristic of the samples’ sequence, length, concentration, and solvent conditions. Resulting shifts in melting and aggregation points compared to a reference are indicative of sample thermal stability under varying conditions.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Step1: Samples can be diluted, pooled, mixed, incubated, and/or annealed in preparation for thermal shift analysis. Sample dilution occurs prior to sample pooling. When all samples in a pool are diluted, the total number of dilutions of each sample in the pool must match. When one sample in a pool is diluted and its partner is not diluted, the undiluted pooling partner will be pooled with each dilution of its partner at the desired AliquotAmount. Step2: Prepared samples are transferred into instrument compatible containers. For the Uncle multimode spectrophotometer, samples are loaded into a 16 well quartz capillary strip. For the ViiA 7 Real-Time thermocycler, samples are loaded into a 384-well v-bottom optical assay plate. Step3: Prepared samples are loaded into the instrument and equilibrated to the starting temperature of the following thermal ramp. A total of three capillary strips can be loaded into the Uncle at once. Step4: Sample fluorescence (and static light scattering if desired) measurement during thermal ramp. For the Uncle, fluorescence and static light scattering are measured for each capillary independently. For the ViiA 7, fluorescence measurements are collected at each excitation wavelength simultaneously for all wells. Steps 3 & 4 are repeated for each heating and cooling cycle. Step5: Data is assessed using AnalyzeMeltingPoint to determine the melting temperature of samples. Static light scattering data from the Uncle can also be analyzed to determine relative changes in aggregation temperature of samples.



Instrumentation

Uncle

Model[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer, "id:4pO6dM508MbX"]

Figure 2.1.1: The Uncle is a multimode spectrophotometer with the capacity to interrogate forty eight samples in one run. Samples must be assayed in Uncle compatible capillary strips. Each strip contains 16 quartz capillaries and each capillary requires 9 uL of sample. Sample fluorescence and static light scattering intensity are excited by 266 nm and 473 nm long-life lasers and detected by a full-spectrum spectrometer consisting of a CCD camera pixel array. Excitation laser power can be specified from opaque to full power (0 - 100% respectively). Sample dynamic light scattering can be quantified by a 660 nm laser diode and detected using an avalanche photodiode module. For all measurements, each capillary is interrogated independently. Thermal profiles can be programmed into the instrument to interrogate samples at multiple temperatures. Capillary strip temperature is controlled by a thermoelectric heating and cooling plate and can range from 15°C to 95°C.

ViiA 7

Model[Instrument, Thermocycler, "id:D8KAEvdqzXYk"]

Figure 2.2.1: The ViiA 7 offers real-time monitoring of target sequence amplification during 384-well plate-based PCR procedures. The thermocycling profile is programmable in the temperature range from 4 °C to 100 °C, with a maximum ramp rate of 3.4 °C/sec. The ViiA 7's excitation wavelengths of 470, 520, 550, 580, 640, and 662 nm and emission wavelengths of 520, 558, 586, 623, 682, and 711 nm allow monitoring of the amplification targets via a variety of dyes or reporters.

   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.

   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.

2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**

   **Answer**: 
   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor
   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1
   3. Alzheimer's Disease - Amyloid-beta
   4. Antimicrobial Resistance - MurA/B
   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9

   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.
