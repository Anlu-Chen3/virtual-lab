ExperimentNMR[Samples]âŸ¹Protocol

generates a Protocol object for measuring the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of provided Samples.



Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a spectroscopic technique used to identify and characterize the chemical structure of compounds. A sample is inserted into a magnetic field, which causes select nuclei (most commonly 1H and 13C) to absorb radio-frequency radiation. The frequency at which this occurs, and the intensity of this absorption, is proportional to the magnetic field around each nucleus. This magnetic field is heavily dependent on the chemical environment, and so each nucleus will give a characteristic signal depending on its surroundings. This produces a spectrum that allows identification of known molecules or the characterization of the structure of unknown ones.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Step 1: Sample is dissolved in specified NMRSolvent. Step 2: Samples are transferred into NMR tubes. Step 3: The tubes are loaded onto the NMR instrument. Step 4: The spectrum is collected for each of the samples. Step 5 (optional): The data is assessed using AnalyzePeaks.



Instrumentation

Ascend 500

Model[Instrument, NMR, "id:6V0npvK61r8q"]

Figure 2.1.1: Samples in NMR tubes are lowered into the bore of the NMR instrument. A superconducting magnet cooled by liquid helium generates a strong magnetic field (11.7 T) that surrounds the sample and aligns the spin states of its nuclei. A radio-frequency pulse is applied to the sample which excites the nuclear spin states of the desired nucleus. Once the pulse is turned off, the excited spins emit a decaying rf signal known as a free induction decay (FID) as they return to equilibrium. Because the environment of each nucleus differs, the nature of this FID allows for the characterization of the structure of the provided sample.

Possible Issues

Sample too concentrated

If too much sample is dissolved in too little solvent, the instrument may have a hard time locking onto the solvent's deuterium signal. This may cause substantial tailing in peaks.

Volume too small

If SolventVolume is set too low, the instrument may have trouble shimming. The resulting spectrum may show peak tailing and lower resolution. Recommended SolventVolume is at least 700 Î¼L.

### Revised Agenda Response

In response to the Scientific Critic's feedback, I have further refined our approach to ensure a comprehensive and detailed plan for our drug discovery project using machine learning.

### Answers

1. **What is the specific drug modality that you are proposing?**

   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.

   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.

2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**

   **Answer**: 
   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor
   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1
   3. Alzheimer's Disease - Amyloid-beta
   4. Antimicrobial Resistance - MurA/B
   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9

   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.

- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous feedback between experimental results and computational models ensures adaptive refinement of predictions and workflow adjustments. This iterative process enhances model accuracy and experimental efficiency.

By addressing these areas, the workflow is enhanced to maximize scientific and clinical impact, aligning with the agenda's goals of rigorous validation and impactful application of machine learning in drug discovery.

[end summary 2]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning for drug discovery. Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptides that are designed to bind to a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentNMR protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentNMR[inputs] where you fill in "inputs" with the appropriate inputs. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context with example function calls and the full set of options for the experiment. In general, leave most options at their default values and therefore do not include them in your experiment function call. Only specify options that must be changed from their default value for your specific experiment. For every option that you specify, please state the default value, the different value you chose, and why you chose that value instead of the default.

Medicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Medicinal Chemist

To implement the ExperimentNMR protocol using ECL for our peptide-based therapeutics project, we need to set up the experiment with specific parameters that deviate from the default values to suit our experimental needs. Below is the proposed ExperimentNMR function call, along with explanations for each specified option:

```plaintext
ExperimentNMR[
    Object[Sample, "id:sample123"],  (* Replace with actual sample ID *)
    Nucleus -> "1H",
    DeuteratedSolvent -> DMSO,
    SampleAmount -> 10 * Milligram,
    SolventVolume -> 700 * Microliter,
    NumberOfScans -> 64
]
```

### Specified Options and Justifications:

1. **Nucleus**
   - **Default Value**: "1H"
   - **Chosen Value**: "1H"
   - **Justification**: We are interested in obtaining the proton NMR spectrum to analyze the chemical environment of hydrogen atoms in our peptide samples. This is a standard choice for initial structural characterization.

2. **DeuteratedSolvent**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (Deuterium oxide if no external standard is used)
   - **Chosen Value**: DMSO
   - **Justification**: DMSO is chosen as the solvent because it is a common solvent for peptides, providing good solubility and a clear spectral window for proton NMR. This choice helps in minimizing solvent interference in the spectrum.

3. **SampleAmount**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (5 mg for solids)
   - **Chosen Value**: 10 * Milligram
   - **Justification**: A slightly higher sample amount is chosen to ensure sufficient signal strength for the NMR analysis, especially if the peptide has low solubility or weak signals.

4. **SolventVolume**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (700 Î¼L if not specified)
   - **Chosen Value**: 700 * Microliter
   - **Justification**: The default value is maintained to ensure optimal shimming and signal acquisition. This volume is standard for NMR experiments to avoid issues with peak tailing and resolution.

5. **NumberOfScans**
   - **Default Value**: 16 for 1H
   - **Chosen Value**: 64
   - **Justification**: Increasing the number of scans improves the signal-to-noise ratio, which is crucial for detecting subtle structural features in peptides. This is particularly important for complex molecules where peaks may overlap or be weak.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Sample Preparation**: Ensure the peptide is fully dissolved in DMSO before transferring to the NMR tube to avoid any solubility issues during the experiment.
- **Data Analysis**: Post-experiment, use AnalyzePeaks to identify and assign peaks, which will provide insights into the peptide's structural integrity and any potential modifications.
