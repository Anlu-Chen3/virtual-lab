ExperimentCircularDichroism[Samples]âŸ¹Protocol

generates a Protocol object for measuring the differential absorption of left and right circularly polarized light of the Samples.



Circular Dichroism (CD, aka Electronic Circular Dichroism (ECD)) measures how samples differentially absorb left and right circularly polarized light radiation, either at a specific wavelength or over a range of wavelengths. In UV-Vis experiment (e.g., ExperimentAbsorbanceSpectroscopy, ExperimentUVMelting etc), samples are exposed to the unpolarized light, where its electric and magnetic fields perpendicular oscillate in all directions perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light. In circularly polarized light, the electric field vector rotates around the propagation direction at a constant magnitude, resulting in the electric field vector appearing to trace a circle throughout one wave frequency. Optically active chiral molecules will preferentially absorb one direction of the circularly polarized light. The difference in absorption of the left and right circularly polarized light can be measured and quantified as absorption bands. CD spectroscopy can probe the secondary structure composition of polypeptides/proteins and determine the tertiary structure class of globular proteins.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a CircularDichroism experiment using an Ekko CD plate reader.Step 1:Samples and blanks are loaded to the plate for reading.Step 2 (optional):the sample volume will be measured by the supersonic method to calculate the pathlength.Step 3:Samples are loaded to the instrument.Step 4:The circular dichroism of samples is measured as ellipticity,based on differential absorption of the left and right circularly polarized light of samples.Step 5:Data is plotted and visualized.



Instrumentation

Ekko

Model[Instrument, PlateReader, "id:mnk9jORmGjEw"]

Figure 2.1.1: In an Ekko CD Microplate Reader, a Xenon Lamp emits the full-spectrum light. The light is then split and diffracted into several beams by passing a grating monochromator to emit non-polarized light. The non-polarized light then passes the polarizer to generate linear polarized light. The linear polarized light then passes through the photoelastic modulator to create both left- and right-hand circular polarized light. Finally, the differential absorbed circularly polarized light. The transmitted light is then directed through a prism that splits the beam into wavelengths from 185 nm to 900 nm as measured by the detector.

ExperimentCircularDichroism[mySamples,

 	DetectionWavelength -> {

   		Span[200 * Nanometer, 330 * Nanometer],

   		{220 * Nanometer, 260 * Nanometer, 310 * Nanometer}

### Revised Agenda Response

In response to the Scientific Critic's feedback, I have further refined our approach to ensure a comprehensive and detailed plan for our drug discovery project using machine learning.

### Answers

1. **What is the specific drug modality that you are proposing?**

   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.

   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.

2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**

   **Answer**: 
   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor
   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1
   3. Alzheimer's Disease - Amyloid-beta
   4. Antimicrobial Resistance - MurA/B
   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9

   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.
