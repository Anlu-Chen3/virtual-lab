ExperimentPeptideSynthesis[OligomerModels]âŸ¹Protocol

uses a oligomer OligomerModels to create a Peptide Synthesis Protocol and associated synthesis cycles methods.





Peptide synthesis is the production of peptides, where multiple amino acids are linked via amide bonds. Peptides are chemically synthesized by the condensation reaction of the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another. This can be achieved with classical solution phase synthesis or solid phase synthesis, which is used in this experiment. In solid phase synthesis, amino acids are covalently bound to a solid support material and synthesised step-by-step in a single reaction vessel utilising selective protecting group chemistry. Peptides are attached to the solid support from their C terminus. Peptide synthesis occurs by coupling the carboxyl group of the incoming amino acid to the N-terminus of the growing peptide chain. This C-to-N synthesis is opposite from protein biosynthesis, during which the N-terminus of the incoming amino acid is linked to the C-terminus of the protein chain (N-to-C). The benefit of the solid support is the isolation of synthesis sites, making interference between growing chains impossible. The use of protecting groups is essential to avoid undesirable side reactions during this process. The most common protecting groups for amino groups used in peptide synthesis are 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc), which is used in this experiment, and t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc). Peptide synthesis allows the production of specific sequences facilitating the study protein function and the development of antibiotic drugs, antibodies and peptide biomaterials. ExperimentTotalProteinQuantification, ExperimentMassSpectrometry and ExperimentHPLC with fraction analysis can be run on the results of this experiment to measure the yield, verify the molecular weight and measure percent purity of the product.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a PeptideSynthesis experiment. Step 1: Define the amino acid sequence to be synthesized, including any modifications, by providing a Model[Sample], a Model[Molecule,Oligomer], a Sequence (Peptide["LysTyrValAlaMet"]), Strand (ToStrand[Peptide["LysTyrValAlaMetTyr"]]) or Structure (ToStructure["LysTyrValAlaMetTyrAla", Polymer -> Peptide]). Step 2: The first monomer is loaded to the resin Step 3: The monomers are then expanded with a cycle of a) removal of the Fmoc protecting group from the resin linker or the last amino acid that is currently on the resin, b) the activation of the monomer and c) the addition on the monomer to the resin or resin with linked strand. Step 4: The peptide is liberated from the resin and side chain protecting groups are removed. Step 5: The peptide is purified by using a solution where the desired peptide strands are insoluble and impurities are soluble. This results in the peptides crashing out of solution. Step 6: The peptide is then resuspended in a resuspension buffer.

Example Calls

Resin

The resin that will be used for the synthesis can be controlled via the Resin option. If you would like to use a resin that is pre-downloaded with a monomer, indicate that via the option DownloadResin->False and specify which Resin to use. For example, here we perform one synthesis with a regular resin (where the first monomer will be downloaded onto the resin), and another synthesis with a resin that already contains the first monomer:

ExperimentPeptideSynthesis[{myStrandModel1, myStrandModel2},

 	DownloadResin -> {True, False},

 	Resin -> {

   		Automatic,

   		Model[Sample, Resin, Oligomer, "My Pre-downloaded Resin"]

 	}

]

Cleavage and Sample Storage

By default, the synthesized strands are cleaved from the resin at the end of the synthesis and then resuspended in distilled water. If desired, it is possible to keep the strands on the resin by specifying Cleavage -> False, in which case the uncleaved strands will be stored as a resin slurry in storage buffer. The parameters for these manipulations (such as the buffer and buffer amount) are controlled via the set of Resuspension and Storage options, respectively. In the following example, the first synthesized peptide is being cleaved in 2.5 mL of cleavage solution and then resuspended in 1 mL of resuspension solution, while the second strand is kept uncleaved and is stored as a slurry in 2 mL of storage solution:

ExperimentPeptideSynthesis[{myStrandModel1, myStrandModel2},

 	Cleavage -> {True, False},

 	CleavageSolution -> mySpecialSolution,

 	CleavageVolume -> {2.5 * Milliliter, Automatic},

 	CleavageTime -> {90 * Minute, Automatic},

 	NumberOfCleavageCycles -> {1, Automatic},

 	ResuspensionBuffer -> myOtherSpecialSolution,

 	ResuspensionVolume -> {1 * Milliliter, Automatic},

 	StorageBuffer -> myStorageSolution,

 	StorageVolume -> {Automatic, 2 * Milliliter}

 ]

ExperimentPeptideSynthesis offers flexibility in the way that the cleaved and dried peptide pellet is resuspended in the final resuspension solution. The type of mixing can be specified by ResuspensionMixType as either Pipette, Sonicate or Vortex. NumberOfResuspensionMixes and ResuspensionMixTime provide control over the duration of the mixing. If more thorough mixing is desired, sequential mixing steps can be provided by a list of instruction primitives for each strand. In the following example, the peptide pellet is first resuspended by pipetting up and down 10 times, followed by a 5 minutes sonication and vortexing step to ensure full solubilization of the peptides

ExperimentPeptideSynthesis[myDifficultStrandModel1,

 	ResuspensionMixPrimitives -> {

   		Mix[MixType -> Pipette, NumberOfMixes -> 10],

   		Mix[MixType -> Vortex, Time -> (5 * Minute)],

   		Mix[MixType -> Sonicate, Time -> (5 * Minute)]

   	}

 ]



Possible Issues

No yield

For a difficult strands the chemical steps, including resin swelling, resin downloading, coupling, cleavage and resuspension, used to synthesize a strand can be controlled with the Primatives and ResuspensionMixPrimitives options.

Too many side products

Side products can be reduced by increasing the number washes between steps.

   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.

   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.

2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**

   **Answer**: 
   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor
   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1

   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9

   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.

## User

Scientific Critic, please critique Medicinal Chemist's most recent answer. In your critique, suggest improvements that directly address the agenda and any agenda questions. Prioritize simple solutions over unnecessarily complex ones, but demand more detail where detail is lacking. Additionally, validate whether the answer strictly adheres to the agenda and any agenda questions and provide corrective feedback if it does not. Only provide feedback; do not implement the answer yourself.

## Scientific Critic

The Medicinal Chemist's response provides a well-structured approach to implementing the `ExperimentPeptideSynthesis` protocol using ECL. However, there are several areas where improvements and additional details are necessary to ensure the response fully aligns with the agenda and its requirements:

1. **Alignment with Agenda Goals**:
   - The agenda emphasizes the need for high clinical value and impactful application of machine learning. While the response focuses on the technical setup of the peptide synthesis, it lacks explicit connections to how this setup contributes to these broader goals. It would be beneficial to briefly mention how the chosen parameters (e.g., increased scale, specific resuspension techniques) support the clinical and scientific objectives of the project.

2. **Justification of Chosen Values**:
   - While some justifications are provided, they could be more detailed. For example, the rationale for increasing the scale to 10 micromoles mentions ensuring sufficient material for validation experiments. However, it would be helpful to specify the expected yield and how it quantitatively supports the subsequent experiments.
   - Similarly, the choice of sonication for resuspension should include a brief explanation of why this method is preferred over others, such as pipetting or vortexing, in the context of the specific peptides being synthesized.

3. **Default Values and Changes**:
   - The response correctly identifies default values and changes, but it could benefit from a more systematic approach. For instance, listing all default values first and then explaining the changes would provide clearer structure and readability.

4. **Risk Management and Contingency Plans**:
   - The agenda highlights the importance of risk management. The response should address potential risks associated with the synthesis process, such as peptide degradation or incomplete cleavage, and propose simple contingency plans. This could include alternative synthesis routes or adjustments to the protocol if initial results are unsatisfactory.

5. **Integration with Machine Learning**:
   - The agenda specifies the use of machine learning in the project. The response should briefly mention how machine learning predictions are integrated into the synthesis process, such as optimizing peptide sequences or predicting synthesis outcomes. This would demonstrate the scientific impact of the project.

6. **Decision Points**:
   - While the response outlines the synthesis protocol, it lacks clear decision points for evaluating the success of each step. Including criteria for assessing the quality of synthesized peptides (e.g., purity thresholds, structural integrity) would align with the agenda's focus on rigorous validation.

By addressing these points, the response would better align with the agenda's goals and provide a more comprehensive and detailed plan for implementing the `ExperimentPeptideSynthesis` protocol.

## User

Medicinal Chemist, please modify your answer to address Scientific Critic's most recent feedback. Remember that your ultimate goal is to make improvements that better address the agenda.

For example, what specific alternative synthesis routes or protocol adjustments are considered if initial results are unsatisfactory? Providing a concrete example would enhance the robustness of the risk management strategy.

3. **Decision Points and Criteria**:
   - The decision points are well-defined, but it would be helpful to include how these criteria are determined. For instance, why is a Kd of <10 Î¼M chosen as the threshold for binding affinity? Clarifying the basis for these thresholds (e.g., literature benchmarks, clinical relevance) would add depth to the decision-making process.

4. **Simplification of Explanations**:
   - Some explanations, such as those for resuspension techniques, could be simplified. For example, instead of detailing the technical aspects of sonication, focus on its practical benefits, such as ensuring peptide solubility for accurate analysis.

5. **Integration with ECL Capabilities**:
   - The agenda emphasizes the use of ECL for all experimental validation. It would be beneficial to mention how ECL's capabilities specifically support the synthesis and validation processes, such as automated workflows or data integration features that enhance efficiency and accuracy.

6. **Alignment with Timeline Constraints**:
   - The response should address how the proposed synthesis protocol fits within the 3-month experimental timeline.
