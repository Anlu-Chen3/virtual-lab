ExperimentBioconjugation[SamplePools, NewIdentityModels]âŸ¹Protocol

generates a Protocol object to covalently bind SamplePools through chemical crosslinking to create a sample composed of NewIdentityModels. Bioconjugation reactions are a restricted form of synthesis where conjugations: 1) occur in aqueous solution, 2) occur at atmospheric conditions, 3) are low volume, 4) do not require slow addition of reagents, 5) and do not require reaction monitoring.



Bioconjugation chemically links molecules together where the resulting molecule takes on properties of all parent molecules. This procedure is typically used to modify proteins, antibodies, solid phase supports, and oligomers. Common conjugates are fluorophores, nanoparticles, biotin, and horseradish peroxidase. First, if necessary, the input sample is functionalized or activated to prepare covalent binding sites to accept the conjugate. The activated input sample is then incubated with the conjugates and a covalent bond is formed. The reaction can be quenched to deactivate any unreacted binding sites. Downstream purification may be used to separate conjugated samples from the reaction components prior to use in other assays.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Bioconjugation covalently binds a biomolecule to a molecule of interest. Optional Step 1: Biomolecules can be activated to prepare and expose binding sites prior to conjugation. Activation parameters can be used to specify the activation reagent (ActivationReagent, ActivationReagentVolume), mixing of the activation sample (ActivationMix, ActivationMixType, etc.), the incubation time (ActivationTime), the incubation temperature (ActivationTemperature), and any post activation washing if desired (PostActivationWash). Step 2: The conjugation samples are mixed (ConjugationMix, ConjugationMixType, etc) at the desired ratio incubated for the ConjugationTime at the ConjugationTemperature. During this step, covalent bonds are formed between the conjugation samples to create a new molecule characterized by properties of each individual conjugation molecule. Optional Step 3: Unreacted conjugates can be quenched using the QuenchReaction option to deactivate any reactive sites or inhibit the molecular properties of any unconjugated molecules. Step 4: The resulting conjugated molecule can be further purified using PostConjugationWorkup options or used in downstream assays. This process is ideal for small volume conjugations of antibodies, proteins, oligomers, and microbeads including xMap Luminex beads. All steps of this experiment use ExperimentSampleManipulation primitives such as Transfer, Incubate, Filter, and Pellet. For more information on options available in these primitives or to understand how ExperimentSampleManipulation works please see the corresponding help file.

Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights.
