ExperimentLCMS[Samples]âŸ¹Protocol

generates a Protocol to separate and analyze Samples via Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS).



Liquid chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) separates samples injected into a liquid flow by passage through an adsorbent column (see ExperimentHPLC). After separation, analytes are ionized, selected, and detected in the Mass Spectrometer device (see ExperimentMassSpectrometry). Within, ions are resolved by their mass versus charge state. Optionally, ions can be fragmented by collision with an inert gas, and the resulting product ions can, in turn, be resolved and detected for more information. In total, LC-MS can answer composition questions; for example, proteins, lipids, and metabolites can be identified in a sample. Furthermore, LC-MS can answer concentration questions; for instance, nucleotides can be quantified in a biological sample.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a LCMS experiment. Step 1: The system is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 2: The stationary column is installed and equilibrated to measurement conditions. Step 3: Samples are then introduced into the flow path. Step 4: The analytes are selectively retained on the downstream column. Step 5: Upon exit from the column, the now separated analytes are analyzed according to their physical property using a mass spectrometer. Step 6: After final sample measurement, the Column(s) are rinsed, removed from the system, and stowed. Step 7: After the column is removed, the system is rinsed with cleaning solution.



Instrumentation

Waters Acquity UPLC I-Class PDA

Model[Instrument, HPLC, "id:4pO6dM5lRrl7"]

Figure 2.1.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems. Buffer solutions (up to 4) are steadily pumped through the instrument, consisting of a 6-port valve system, adsorbent column, detectors, and terminates at fraction collection or waste. Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column. Within the column, molecular constituents are separated by adsorption -- a function of the buffers, column, sample properties and temperature. Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals.

Figure 2.1.2: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.

Xevo G2-XS QTOF

Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "id:aXRlGn6KaWdO"]

Figure 2.2.1: Principles of an electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (QTOF). Analytes are flowed through a capillary tube into a heated source box (SourceTemeprature) at the desired InfusionFlowRate. A confluence of the source box temperature, DesolvationTemperature, DesolvationGasFlow, and ESICapillaryVolage result in neubilization, vaporization, and ionization of the analyte stream to generate an electrospray. The electrospray enters the mass spectrometer through the source cone, which serves to focus the ions and excludes contimation via a ConeGasFlow. Within the mass spectrometer, the electrospray is futher refined via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage) to yeild isolated gas-phase ions. Ions are then focused through a stepwave ion guide path via another applied voltage (StepwaveVoltage) into an ion beam. The ions travel through a quadrupole and a collision cell. Lastly, they enter a time-of-flight analyzer which resolves the ions by their mass to charge ratio according to their travel time. Spectra are continuously acquired for ions inside MassDetection hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration. For time independent samples, an average mass spectrum is generated. When coupled with liquid chromatography (see ExperimentLCMS) time-dependent mass spectra are generated instead.

QTRAP 6500

Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "id:N80DNj1aROOD"]

Figure 2.3.1: Principles of an electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-QQQ). Analytes are injected through the capillary tube into the source block at the desired InfusionFlowRate. Once the sample enters the source block, it is evaporated at the DesolvationTemperature under a stream of nitrogen gas with a pressure of DesolvationGasFlow. ESICapillaryVoltage is then applied to the capillary tubing tip to produce an electrospray, which turns into single gas-phase ions due to additional evaporation and desolvation SourceTemperature. Ions, focused by the ConeGasFlow, enter the mass spectrometer through the source cone and follow the ion path via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage). They are then guided through an ion guide path via another applied voltage (IonGuideVoltange) to generate a focused ion beam. Ions travel through the first quadrupole mass analyzer (MS1), where their mass is resolved by their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z, MassDetection). After the MS1, ions enter the collision cell, where they can be fragmented by collision-induced dissociation, resulting in bond breakage and the fragmentation of the molecular ions into smaller fragments. CollisionCellExitVoltage accelerates and guides the fragmented ions to enter the second quadrupole mass analyzer (MS2), where their mass can be resolved again by their m/z (FragmentMassDetection). Spectra are continuously acquired for ions either inside MassDetection as a ranged value or as a fixed value, hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration, and a total mass spectrum is generated.

Figure 3.3: (a),(b) and (c):Various acquisition modes available for ExperimentLCMS using QTOF as the MassAnalyzer. For MS1FullScan mode, the collision cell is turned off, and ions are measured and resolved with just the quadrupole time of flight. For MS1FullScanMS2 mode, one intact mass (MassDetection) is selected in the first quadruple and disassociated into fragment ions with the collision cell. Fragment ions are resolved and detected with the quadrupole time of flight. For DataIndependent mode, scans are alternated between scanning a range of MS1FullScan masses (no fragmentation) and scanning fragmentation of a range of masses (MS2). For DataDependent mode, acquisition is split into cycles. For the first scan of each cycle, a survey is taken where the collision cell is off and only intact masses are measured. The top ranking intact ions are noted, then for each consequent scan of the cycle, a ranking intact ion is fragmented, and the resultant fragment ions are resolved and measured on the quadrupole time of flight. A suite of options are available to control how many ions are ranked, which ones are, and to eliminate redundancies. (d):Various mass spectrometry scan modes available for ExperimentLCMS using TripleQuad as the MassAnalyzer. In Full Scan Mode, the entire MS1 range is scanned and fragmentation is off. In SelectedIonMonitoring, select MS1 masses (per the MassDetection option) are monitored and measured without fragmentation. In PrecursorIonScan mode, fragmentation is on, and fragment ion is selected (per the FragmentMassDetection option), while MS1 masses are scanned across a range (MassDetection). In NeutralIonLoss mode, both MS1 and MS2 masses are scanned, to track specific MS1/MS2 combinations for neutral ion loss. In ProductIonScan, an MS1 mass is selected (MassDetection) and a range of MS2 mass is scanned to survey fragmentation patterns of the parent mass. In MultipleReactionMonitoring mode, both MS1 and MS2 are selected - specific intact and fragment ion pairs are monitored.

For MS1FullScan mode, the collision cell is turned off, and ions are measured and resolved with just the quadrupole time of flight. For MS1FullScanMS2 mode, one intact mass (MassDetection) is selected in the first quadruple and disassociated into fragment ions with the collision cell. Fragment ions are resolved and detected with the quadrupole time of flight. For DataIndependent mode, scans are alternated between scanning a range of MS1FullScan masses (no fragmentation) and scanning fragmentation of a range of masses (MS2). For DataDependent mode, acquisition is split into cycles. For the first scan of each cycle, a survey is taken where the collision cell is off and only intact masses are measured. The top ranking intact ions are noted, then for each consequent scan of the cycle, a ranking intact ion is fragmented, and the resultant fragment ions are resolved and measured on the quadrupole time of flight. A suite of options are available to control how many ions are ranked, which ones are, and to eliminate redundancies. (d):Various mass spectrometry scan modes available for ExperimentLCMS using TripleQuad as the MassAnalyzer. In Full Scan Mode, the entire MS1 range is scanned and fragmentation is off. In SelectedIonMonitoring, select MS1 masses (per the MassDetection option) are monitored and measured without fragmentation. In PrecursorIonScan mode, fragmentation is on, and fragment ion is selected (per the FragmentMassDetection option), while MS1 masses are scanned across a range (MassDetection). In NeutralIonLoss mode, both MS1 and MS2 masses are scanned, to track specific MS1/MS2 combinations for neutral ion loss. In ProductIonScan, an MS1 mass is selected (MassDetection) and a range of MS2 mass is scanned to survey fragmentation patterns of the parent mass. In MultipleReactionMonitoring mode, both MS1 and MS2 are selected - specific intact and fragment ion pairs are monitored.

     			}

    		}

   	}

 ]

Data Dependent Acquisition

In data dependent acquisition, the measurement is split into cycles (see the figure above). In the first part of the cycle, the intact ions (no fragmentations) are surveyed and considered for fragmentation analysis:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	AcquisitionSurvey -> 20

 ]

A threshold can be specified on whether to consider an intact ion for fragmentation analysis. Likewise, a limit can be placed so that a highly abundant ion is not overly analyzed:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	MinimumThreshold -> (100000 * ArbitraryUnit),

 	AcquisitionLimit -> (2000000 * ArbitraryUnit)

 ]

Various m/z can be excluded from the acquisition program:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	ExclusionMass -> {

   		{All, 656 * Gram / Mole},

   		{All, 657 * Gram / Mole}

   	}

 ]

Masses can be prioritized for fragmentation as they surface during the surveys:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	InclusionMass -> {

   		{Preferential, 987 * Gram / Mole},

   		{Preferential, 1013 * Gram / Mole}

   	}

 ]

Masses can be prioritized for fragmentation as they surface during the surveys:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	InclusionMass -> {

   		{Preferential, 987 * Gram / Mole},

   		{Preferential, 1013 * Gram / Mole}

   	}

 ]

Redundant isotopes can excluded from acquisition surveys:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, SurveyIsotopeExclusion -> True]

Redundant charge states can excluded from acquisition surveys:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, SurveyChargeStateExclusion -> True]

Standards and Blanks

ExperimentLCMS can be used to quantify analytes in a sample, in which case, a Standard sample is employed to serve as reference. A standard can be submitted before and after the injection sequence of the samples simply by running:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast]

Likewise, a Blank sample can be used to see if there is any background from the injection process. To run a blank to occur between every 5 samples, use the following command:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, BlankFrequency -> 5]

PhotoDiodeArray detection

PhotoDiodeArray detection involves passes light across a range of wavelengths and measures how much light is absorbed for each even wavelength:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[400, 500 * Nanometer],

 	UVFilter -> True

 ]

Injection Table

In addition to specifying frequencies of running standards and blanks, now the injection sequence of samples, standards, blanks, and column primes/flushes can be explicitly articulated as well. In this case, an additional column flush is specified after the injection of the second sample:

customInjectionTable = customInjectionTable = {

    	{ColumnPrime, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod1},

    	{Sample, mySample1, 2 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{Blank, myBlank1, 5 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{Sample, mySample2, 3 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{ColumnFlush, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod1},

    	{Standard, myStandard1, 2 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{Sample, mySample3, 5 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{ColumnFlush, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod1}

    }

ExperimentLCMS[{mySample1, mySample2, mySample3},

 	InjectionTable -> customInjectionTable

 ]



Preferred Input Containers

The autosampler can take 2mL deep well plates.

The autosampler can take normal vials routinely used in HPLC analysis.



Data Processing

The data can be viewed by PlotChromatographyMassSpectra:

PlotChromatographyMassSpectra[

 	Object[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, "Sample LCMS Data"]

 ]

The data can be viewed by different types by spcifying PlotType options:

PlotChromatographyMassSpectra[

 	Object[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, "Sample LCMS Data"],

 	PlotType -> AbsorbanceChromatogram

 ]

Use the PlotType and MassSpectrumTimeRange to plot mass spectrum data with in a certain time range:

PlotChromatographyMassSpectra[

 	Object[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, "Sample LCMS Data"],

 	MassSpectrumTimeRange -> {Span[5 * Minute, 5.5 * Minute]},

 	PlotType -> MassSpectrum

 ]

Use ExcludeRange to specify one or more ranges of m/z values to exclude from different type of plots:

PlotChromatographyMassSpectra[

 	Object[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, "Sample LCMS Data"],

 	MassSpectrumTimeRange -> {Span[5 * Minute, 5.5 * Minute]},

 	PlotType -> WaterfallPlot,

 	ExcludeRange -> {

   		Span[0 * Dalton, 300 * Dalton],

   		Span[500 * Dalton, 700 * Dalton]

   	}

 ]



Possible Issues

Equilibration

Equilibrate to the correct buffer conditions at the end of each gradient to reach a state that is appropriate for the start of the next gradient.

Column flush

The column will end up being stored in whatever the final gradient solvent conditions are so that should be considered for column protection.

Column fouling

Consider using a GuardColumn to preserve column lifetime. Examine injections of standards over time to ensure that the column is performing to satisfaction.

Filter sample and buffer

Samples should not have particulates; otherwise, the system will over-pressurize. Consider filtering any samples or buffers used for the LCMS experiment.

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.

## User

Scientific Critic, please critique Medicinal Chemist's most recent answer. In your critique, suggest improvements that directly address the agenda and any agenda questions. Prioritize simple solutions over unnecessarily complex ones, but demand more detail where detail is lacking. Additionally, validate whether the answer strictly adheres to the agenda and any agenda questions and provide corrective feedback if it does not. Only provide feedback; do not implement the answer yourself.

## Scientific Critic

The Medicinal Chemist's response provides a solid foundation for implementing the `ExperimentLCMS` protocol using ECL. However, there are areas where further detail and clarity are needed to ensure the experiment aligns with the agenda's goals and constraints. Here are some points for improvement:

1. **Alignment with Agenda Goals**:
   - The agenda emphasizes the need for high clinical value and impactful application of machine learning. While the response outlines the LCMS setup, it lacks a direct connection to how this experiment contributes to these overarching goals. It would be beneficial to explicitly state how the LCMS results will feed back into the machine learning models or how they will be used to refine peptide design for clinical applications.

2. **Justification for Option Choices**:
   - While the chosen options are justified, the rationale could be expanded. For instance, the choice of a custom gradient should be supported by specific examples or literature references that demonstrate its effectiveness in similar peptide analyses. Additionally, the decision to use the TripleQuadrupole over the default QTOF should be backed by data or case studies that highlight its advantages for the specific peptides being analyzed.

3. **Default Values and Changes**:
   - The response mentions default values but does not consistently explain why the default settings are inadequate for this experiment. For example, why is the default QTOF not suitable for this analysis? Providing a comparison or specific limitations of the default settings would strengthen the justification for changes.

4. **Experimental Context**:
   - The agenda specifies a 3-month limit for experiments. It would be helpful to include a brief discussion on how the proposed LCMS setup fits within this timeline. Are there any anticipated challenges or bottlenecks that could affect the schedule? How will these be managed?

5. **Integration with Machine Learning**:
   - The agenda highlights the integration of machine learning. The response should elaborate on how the LCMS data will be used to validate or improve machine learning models. For example, will the data be used to train models on peptide stability or binding affinity? How will this integration be achieved practically?

6. **Decision Points**:
   - The agenda outlines the need for decision points in the validation process. The response should specify what criteria will be used to determine if the LCMS results are satisfactory and what actions will be taken if they are not. This could include thresholds for purity or mass accuracy that, if not met, would trigger a redesign or further optimization of the peptides.

By addressing these points, the Medicinal Chemist can ensure that the experiment not only meets the technical requirements but also aligns with the strategic goals of the project, maximizing its scientific and clinical impact.

This iterative feedback loop ensures that the peptides developed have high clinical relevance, targeting diseases like Type 2 Diabetes and Cancer with precision.

2. **Justification for Option Choices**:
   - **MassAnalyzer**: The TripleQuadrupole is chosen over the default QTOF due to its superior sensitivity and specificity for low-abundance peptides, which is critical for detecting subtle differences in peptide modifications predicted by machine learning models. Literature supports its effectiveness in quantitative peptide analysis, providing more reliable data for model refinement.
   - **Gradient**: The custom gradient is designed to optimize the separation of peptides based on their hydrophobicity, ensuring better resolution and peak shape. This is informed by previous studies that demonstrate improved separation efficiency with similar gradients for complex peptide mixtures.

3. **Default Values and Changes**:
   - **IonMode**: Positive ion mode is maintained as it is typically more effective for peptide analysis due to the presence of basic residues that readily accept protons, enhancing ionization efficiency.
   - **MassDetection**: The specified mass range covers the expected mass of our peptides, ensuring comprehensive detection. This range is critical for confirming the molecular weight of peptides, a key parameter in validating machine learning predictions.

4. **Experimental Context and Timeline**:
   - The LCMS experiment is designed to fit within the 3-month timeline by ensuring efficient data acquisition and analysis. Potential bottlenecks, such as instrument availability or sample preparation delays, will be managed through pre-scheduling and parallel processing of samples where possible.

5. **Integration with Machine Learning**:
   - The LCMS data will be used to train and validate machine learning models focused on predicting peptide stability and binding affinity. This integration is achieved by feeding experimental results back into the models to improve prediction accuracy, thus enhancing the design of subsequent peptide iterations.

6. **Decision Points**:
   - **LCMS Results**: If purity and mass do not meet thresholds (>95% purity, mass accuracy within 0.1 Da), the peptide design will be revisited. This ensures that only peptides meeting stringent quality criteria proceed to further validation steps.
   - **Thresholds and Actions**: Specific thresholds for purity and mass accuracy are set to ensure transparency and reproducibility. If these are not met, the peptide will undergo redesign or optimization, guided by insights from the machine learning models.

By incorporating these improvements, the experiment setup not only meets technical requirements but also aligns with the strategic goals of the project, maximizing its scientific and clinical impact.
