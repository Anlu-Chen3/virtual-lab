ExperimentLCMS[Samples]âŸ¹Protocol

generates a Protocol to separate and analyze Samples via Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS).



Liquid chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) separates samples injected into a liquid flow by passage through an adsorbent column (see ExperimentHPLC). After separation, analytes are ionized, selected, and detected in the Mass Spectrometer device (see ExperimentMassSpectrometry). Within, ions are resolved by their mass versus charge state. Optionally, ions can be fragmented by collision with an inert gas, and the resulting product ions can, in turn, be resolved and detected for more information. In total, LC-MS can answer composition questions; for example, proteins, lipids, and metabolites can be identified in a sample. Furthermore, LC-MS can answer concentration questions; for instance, nucleotides can be quantified in a biological sample.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a LCMS experiment. Step 1: The system is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 2: The stationary column is installed and equilibrated to measurement conditions. Step 3: Samples are then introduced into the flow path. Step 4: The analytes are selectively retained on the downstream column. Step 5: Upon exit from the column, the now separated analytes are analyzed according to their physical property using a mass spectrometer. Step 6: After final sample measurement, the Column(s) are rinsed, removed from the system, and stowed. Step 7: After the column is removed, the system is rinsed with cleaning solution.



Instrumentation

Waters Acquity UPLC I-Class PDA

Model[Instrument, HPLC, "id:4pO6dM5lRrl7"]

Figure 2.1.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems. Buffer solutions (up to 4) are steadily pumped through the instrument, consisting of a 6-port valve system, adsorbent column, detectors, and terminates at fraction collection or waste. Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column. Within the column, molecular constituents are separated by adsorption -- a function of the buffers, column, sample properties and temperature. Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals.

Figure 2.1.2: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.

Xevo G2-XS QTOF

Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "id:aXRlGn6KaWdO"]

Figure 2.2.1: Principles of an electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (QTOF). Analytes are flowed through a capillary tube into a heated source box (SourceTemeprature) at the desired InfusionFlowRate. A confluence of the source box temperature, DesolvationTemperature, DesolvationGasFlow, and ESICapillaryVolage result in neubilization, vaporization, and ionization of the analyte stream to generate an electrospray. The electrospray enters the mass spectrometer through the source cone, which serves to focus the ions and excludes contimation via a ConeGasFlow. Within the mass spectrometer, the electrospray is futher refined via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage) to yeild isolated gas-phase ions. Ions are then focused through a stepwave ion guide path via another applied voltage (StepwaveVoltage) into an ion beam. The ions travel through a quadrupole and a collision cell. Lastly, they enter a time-of-flight analyzer which resolves the ions by their mass to charge ratio according to their travel time. Spectra are continuously acquired for ions inside MassDetection hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration. For time independent samples, an average mass spectrum is generated. When coupled with liquid chromatography (see ExperimentLCMS) time-dependent mass spectra are generated instead.

QTRAP 6500

Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "id:N80DNj1aROOD"]

Figure 2.3.1: Principles of an electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-QQQ). Analytes are injected through the capillary tube into the source block at the desired InfusionFlowRate. Once the sample enters the source block, it is evaporated at the DesolvationTemperature under a stream of nitrogen gas with a pressure of DesolvationGasFlow. ESICapillaryVoltage is then applied to the capillary tubing tip to produce an electrospray, which turns into single gas-phase ions due to additional evaporation and desolvation SourceTemperature. Ions, focused by the ConeGasFlow, enter the mass spectrometer through the source cone and follow the ion path via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage). They are then guided through an ion guide path via another applied voltage (IonGuideVoltange) to generate a focused ion beam. Ions travel through the first quadrupole mass analyzer (MS1), where their mass is resolved by their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z, MassDetection). After the MS1, ions enter the collision cell, where they can be fragmented by collision-induced dissociation, resulting in bond breakage and the fragmentation of the molecular ions into smaller fragments. CollisionCellExitVoltage accelerates and guides the fragmented ions to enter the second quadrupole mass analyzer (MS2), where their mass can be resolved again by their m/z (FragmentMassDetection). Spectra are continuously acquired for ions either inside MassDetection as a ranged value or as a fixed value, hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration, and a total mass spectrum is generated.

Figure 3.3: (a),(b) and (c):Various acquisition modes available for ExperimentLCMS using QTOF as the MassAnalyzer. For MS1FullScan mode, the collision cell is turned off, and ions are measured and resolved with just the quadrupole time of flight. For MS1FullScanMS2 mode, one intact mass (MassDetection) is selected in the first quadruple and disassociated into fragment ions with the collision cell. Fragment ions are resolved and detected with the quadrupole time of flight. For DataIndependent mode, scans are alternated between scanning a range of MS1FullScan masses (no fragmentation) and scanning fragmentation of a range of masses (MS2). For DataDependent mode, acquisition is split into cycles. For the first scan of each cycle, a survey is taken where the collision cell is off and only intact masses are measured. The top ranking intact ions are noted, then for each consequent scan of the cycle, a ranking intact ion is fragmented, and the resultant fragment ions are resolved and measured on the quadrupole time of flight. A suite of options are available to control how many ions are ranked, which ones are, and to eliminate redundancies. (d):Various mass spectrometry scan modes available for ExperimentLCMS using TripleQuad as the MassAnalyzer. In Full Scan Mode, the entire MS1 range is scanned and fragmentation is off. In SelectedIonMonitoring, select MS1 masses (per the MassDetection option) are monitored and measured without fragmentation. In PrecursorIonScan mode, fragmentation is on, and fragment ion is selected (per the FragmentMassDetection option), while MS1 masses are scanned across a range (MassDetection). In NeutralIonLoss mode, both MS1 and MS2 masses are scanned, to track specific MS1/MS2 combinations for neutral ion loss. In ProductIonScan, an MS1 mass is selected (MassDetection) and a range of MS2 mass is scanned to survey fragmentation patterns of the parent mass. In MultipleReactionMonitoring mode, both MS1 and MS2 are selected - specific intact and fragment ion pairs are monitored.

For MS1FullScan mode, the collision cell is turned off, and ions are measured and resolved with just the quadrupole time of flight. For MS1FullScanMS2 mode, one intact mass (MassDetection) is selected in the first quadruple and disassociated into fragment ions with the collision cell. Fragment ions are resolved and detected with the quadrupole time of flight. For DataIndependent mode, scans are alternated between scanning a range of MS1FullScan masses (no fragmentation) and scanning fragmentation of a range of masses (MS2). For DataDependent mode, acquisition is split into cycles. For the first scan of each cycle, a survey is taken where the collision cell is off and only intact masses are measured. The top ranking intact ions are noted, then for each consequent scan of the cycle, a ranking intact ion is fragmented, and the resultant fragment ions are resolved and measured on the quadrupole time of flight. A suite of options are available to control how many ions are ranked, which ones are, and to eliminate redundancies. (d):Various mass spectrometry scan modes available for ExperimentLCMS using TripleQuad as the MassAnalyzer. In Full Scan Mode, the entire MS1 range is scanned and fragmentation is off. In SelectedIonMonitoring, select MS1 masses (per the MassDetection option) are monitored and measured without fragmentation. In PrecursorIonScan mode, fragmentation is on, and fragment ion is selected (per the FragmentMassDetection option), while MS1 masses are scanned across a range (MassDetection). In NeutralIonLoss mode, both MS1 and MS2 masses are scanned, to track specific MS1/MS2 combinations for neutral ion loss. In ProductIonScan, an MS1 mass is selected (MassDetection) and a range of MS2 mass is scanned to survey fragmentation patterns of the parent mass. In MultipleReactionMonitoring mode, both MS1 and MS2 are selected - specific intact and fragment ion pairs are monitored.

    		}

   	}

 ]

Data Dependent Acquisition

In data dependent acquisition, the measurement is split into cycles (see the figure above). In the first part of the cycle, the intact ions (no fragmentations) are surveyed and considered for fragmentation analysis:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	AcquisitionSurvey -> 20

 ]

A threshold can be specified on whether to consider an intact ion for fragmentation analysis. Likewise, a limit can be placed so that a highly abundant ion is not overly analyzed:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	MinimumThreshold -> (100000 * ArbitraryUnit),

 	AcquisitionLimit -> (2000000 * ArbitraryUnit)

 ]

Various m/z can be excluded from the acquisition program:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	ExclusionMass -> {

   		{All, 656 * Gram / Mole},

   		{All, 657 * Gram / Mole}

   	}

 ]

Masses can be prioritized for fragmentation as they surface during the surveys:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,

 	InclusionMass -> {

   		{Preferential, 987 * Gram / Mole},

   		{Preferential, 1013 * Gram / Mole}

   	}

 ]

Masses can be prioritized for fragmentation as they surface during the surveys:

 ]

Redundant isotopes can excluded from acquisition surveys:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, SurveyIsotopeExclusion -> True]

Redundant charge states can excluded from acquisition surveys:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, SurveyChargeStateExclusion -> True]

Standards and Blanks

ExperimentLCMS can be used to quantify analytes in a sample, in which case, a Standard sample is employed to serve as reference. A standard can be submitted before and after the injection sequence of the samples simply by running:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast]

Likewise, a Blank sample can be used to see if there is any background from the injection process. To run a blank to occur between every 5 samples, use the following command:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, BlankFrequency -> 5]

PhotoDiodeArray detection

PhotoDiodeArray detection involves passes light across a range of wavelengths and measures how much light is absorbed for each even wavelength:

ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,

 	AbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[400, 500 * Nanometer],

 	UVFilter -> True

 ]

Injection Table

In addition to specifying frequencies of running standards and blanks, now the injection sequence of samples, standards, blanks, and column primes/flushes can be explicitly articulated as well. In this case, an additional column flush is specified after the injection of the second sample:

customInjectionTable = customInjectionTable = {

    	{ColumnPrime, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod1},

    	{Sample, mySample1, 2 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{Blank, myBlank1, 5 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{Sample, mySample2, 3 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{ColumnFlush, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod1},

    	{Standard, myStandard1, 2 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{Sample, mySample3, 5 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},

    	{ColumnFlush, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,

     myMassAcquisitionMethod1}

    }

ExperimentLCMS[{mySample1, mySample2, mySample3},

 	InjectionTable -> customInjectionTable

 ]



Preferred Input Containers

The autosampler can take 2mL deep well plates.

The autosampler can take normal vials routinely used in HPLC analysis.



Data Processing

The data can be viewed by PlotChromatographyMassSpectra:

PlotChromatographyMassSpectra[

 	Object[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, "Sample LCMS Data"]

 ]

The data can be viewed by different types by spcifying PlotType options:

PlotChromatographyMassSpectra[

 	Object[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, "Sample LCMS Data"],

 	PlotType -> AbsorbanceChromatogram

 ]

Use the PlotType and MassSpectrumTimeRange to plot mass spectrum data with in a certain time range:

PlotChromatographyMassSpectra[

 	Object[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, "Sample LCMS Data"],

 	MassSpectrumTimeRange -> {Span[5 * Minute, 5.5 * Minute]},

 	PlotType -> MassSpectrum

 ]

Use ExcludeRange to specify one or more ranges of m/z values to exclude from different type of plots:

PlotChromatographyMassSpectra[

 	Object[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, "Sample LCMS Data"],

 	MassSpectrumTimeRange -> {Span[5 * Minute, 5.5 * Minute]},

 	PlotType -> WaterfallPlot,

 	ExcludeRange -> {

   		Span[0 * Dalton, 300 * Dalton],

   		Span[500 * Dalton, 700 * Dalton]

   	}

 ]



Possible Issues

Equilibration

Equilibrate to the correct buffer conditions at the end of each gradient to reach a state that is appropriate for the start of the next gradient.

Column flush

The column will end up being stored in whatever the final gradient solvent conditions are so that should be considered for column protection.

Column fouling

Consider using a GuardColumn to preserve column lifetime. Examine injections of standards over time to ensure that the column is performing to satisfaction.

Filter sample and buffer

Samples should not have particulates; otherwise, the system will over-pressurize. Consider filtering any samples or buffers used for the LCMS experiment.

   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.

2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**

   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.

1. **Alignment with Agenda Goals**:
   - The agenda emphasizes high clinical value and the impactful application of machine learning. While the response focuses on the technical setup of the LCMS experiment, it lacks explicit connections to how this setup contributes to these broader goals. It would be beneficial to discuss how the chosen parameters and the resulting data will feed back into the machine learning models to improve peptide design and therapeutic efficacy.

2. **Detail on Default Values**:
   - While the chosen values are justified, the response could benefit from a more explicit mention of the default values for each option. This would provide a clearer contrast and help justify why the changes are necessary. For example, explicitly stating the default mass range for MassDetection would clarify why the specified range was chosen.

3. **Justification for Acquisition Windows**:
   - The choice of acquisition windows is mentioned, but the rationale could be expanded. Why are these specific time spans chosen? Are they based on prior knowledge of peptide elution times, or are they derived from preliminary experiments? Providing this context would strengthen the justification.

4. **Integration with Machine Learning**:
   - The response should explicitly address how the LCMS data will be used to refine machine learning models. For instance, how will the data-dependent acquisition mode contribute to model training or validation? This connection is crucial for demonstrating the scientific impact of the machine learning application.

5. **Risk Management and Contingency Plans**:
   - The agenda highlights the importance of risk management. The response could include potential risks associated with the LCMS setup and how they will be mitigated. For example, what steps will be taken if the mass spectrometer calibration fails or if the peptide samples do not ionize as expected?

6. **Decision Points and Iterative Feedback**:
   - While the response outlines the experimental setup, it does not discuss decision points or how iterative feedback will be incorporated. Clarifying how the results of the LCMS experiment will influence subsequent experimental or computational steps would align the response more closely with the agenda's emphasis on iterative refinement.

By addressing these points, the Medicinal Chemist can provide a more comprehensive and aligned response that not only details the technical setup but also connects it to the overarching goals of the project.
