Because of the different affinity between the compounds in the liquid mixture (known as the mobile phase) and the solid sorbent (known as the stationary phase). In case of positive strategy SPE, the desired analytes are retained on the stationary phase while the mobile phase passes through the resin sorbent packed in the SPE cartridge. The analytes of interest are then removed from the cartridge and collected into the desired eluent for downstream analysis. On the other hand, for negative strategy SPE, the contaminants are retained on the stationary phase, while the desired analytes pass through the resin sorbent with the mobile phase.On the whole, SPE can be used to purify different samples and isolate or concentration analytes of interest from a wide variety of matrices.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a Positive ExtractionStrategy of Experiment Solid Phase Extraction (SPE). Step 1 (Optional): The ExtractionCartridge is flushed with PreFlushingSolution (optional) to remove any residues from the packed sorbent prior to start of the protocol. Step 2 (Optional): The ExtractionCartridge is rinsed with ConditioningSolution (optional) to wet and condition the sorbent in order to ensure consistent interaction between the stationary phase and the sample. Step 3: The sample is introduced into the ExtractionCartridge to allow the interaction between the components in the sample and the sorbent. If multiple samples are combined into a pool for solid phase extraction experiment, they are dispensed into the same cartridge in a stepwise fashion. Step 4 (Optional): WashingSolution is transferred into the ExtractionCartridge to elute any contaminants out of the cartridge prior to elution of the components of interest. Step 5 - 6 (Optional): Additional SecondaryWashingSolution and TertiaryWashingSolution can be transferred into the ExtractionCartridge to further wash contaminants out of the resin to increase purity of the eluent. Step 7 (Optional): ElutingSolution is transferred into the ExtractionCartridge to disrupt the interaction between the sample and the sorbent and elute the desired analytes into the collection container.\n\nFigure 1.2: Procedural overview of a Negative ExtractionStrategy of Experiment Solid Phase Extraction (SPE). Step 1 (Optional): The ExtractionCartridge is flushed with PreFlushingSolution (optional) to remove any residues from the packed sorbent prior to start of the protocol. Step 2 (Optional): The ExtractionCartridge is rinsed with ConditioningSolution to wet and condition the sorbent in order to ensure consistent interaction between the stationary phase and the sample. Step 3: The sample is introduced into the ExtractionCartridge to allow the interaction between the contaminants to bind with the sorbent, while desired analytes pass through the resin sorbent and are collected as SamplesOut. If multiple samples are combined into a pool for solid phase extraction experiment, they are dispensed into the same cartridge in stepwise fashion.\n\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\nGX-271 for Solid Phase Extraction\n\nModel[Instrument, LiquidHandler, \"id:o1k9jAKOwLl8\"]\n\nFigure 2.1.1: A 6-port valve syringe pump system is connected to a robotic arm controlled needle in the liquid handler to aspirate and dispense reagents and apply gas toward the sorbent packed ExtractionCartridges for solid-phase extraction of the desired analytes from the samples. Sequentially in each step of the SPE experiment process, Sequentially in each steps of SPE process PreFlushingSolution (Optional), ConditioningSolution (Optional), SamplesIn, WashingSolution (Optional), SecondaryWashingSolution (Optional), TertiaryWashingSolution (Optional) and ElutingSolution (Optional) are aspirated into the syringe from their original containers and then dispensed into the SPE Cartridges via positive displacement of the syringe to allow thorough interaction between the corresponding buffer or sample with the sorbent resin bed in the cartridge. Gas is then applied through the needle to elute the mobile phase into either Waste container or SamplesOut container, depending on the step in the SPE experiment process. The collected SamplesOut are stored for downstream experiments.\n\nEppendorf 5920R\n\nModel[Instrument, Centrifuge, \"id:eGakldJEz14E\"]\n\nFigure 2.2.1: Samples to be centrifuged are counterbalanced in available centrifuge bucket slots. The centrifuge spins the buckets around the axis of the main rotor, while applying optional cooling to prevent a buildup of heat caused by the friction of spinning the rotor. As the samples spin, they are exposed to a centrifugal force that is significantly larger than typical gravitational acceleration. The samples can subsequently be collected at the end of the experiment.\n\nFilter Block\n\nModel[Instrument, FilterBlock, \"id:rea9jl1orrGr\"]\n\nFigure 2.3.1: Instrument diagram for the Filter Block: A filter plate containing sample is positioned inside of a collar which fits over a collection plate within the vacuum manifold. A vacuum generates a pressure gradient that causes the sample to flow through the filter into the collection vessel.\n\nBiotage PRESSURE+ 48 Positive Pressure Manifold\n\nModel[Instrument, PressureManifold, \"id:zGj91a7mElrL\"]\n\nFigure 2.4.1: A positive pressure manifold that use a compressed gas both to seal the Extractioncartridge and displace reagents, designed specifically 3 mL and 6mL tabless vacuum ExtractionCartridge. Sequentially in each steps of SPE process PreFlushingSolution (Optional), ConditioningSolution (Optional), SamplesIn, WashingSolution (Optional), SecondaryWashingSolution (Optional), TertiaryWashingSolution (Optional) and ElutingSolution (Optional) are manually aspirated by operators and then dispensed on to ExtractionCartridge. Afterwards, the pressure manifold then manually lowered to seal with ExtractionCartridge and positive pressure is applied to the reagents in ExtractionCartridge to pass through ExtractionSorbent. The flowthrough reagents from each steps can be collected in 15 mL conical tube and stored for downstream experiments or discarded.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nGeneral\n\nSampleLabel\n\nThe label of

This can lead to unanticipated mixing of the organic solutions and the system buffer, causing the machine to falter in delivering volume and pressure to the column.\n\n[end context 1]\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\n### Revised Agenda Response\n\nIn response to the Scientific Critic's feedback, I have further refined our approach to ensure a comprehensive and detailed plan for our drug discovery project using machine learning.\n\n### Answers\n\n1. **What is the specific drug modality that you are proposing?**\n\n   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.\n\n   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.\n\n2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**\n\n   **Answer**: \n   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor\n   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1\n   3. Alzheimer's Disease - Amyloid-beta\n   4. Antimicrobial Resistance - MurA/B\n   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9\n\n   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.\n\n3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**\n\n   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.\n\n2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.\n\n3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.\n\n4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.\n\n5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.\n\nBy incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.\n\n[end summary 1]\n\n[begin summary 2]\n\n### Revised Agenda Response\n\nOur project aims to leverage machine learning for drug discovery, focusing on peptide-based therapeutics.

For instance, if certain peptides consistently show lower recovery rates, the model can be adjusted to predict and optimize for these conditions, improving future peptide designs.\n\n3. **Justification of Solution Choices**:\n   - Methanol is chosen for its strong ability to remove hydrophobic residues, which is particularly important for peptides that may have hydrophobic regions. Ammonium acetate is selected for its buffering capacity, maintaining a stable pH that is conducive to peptide stability. While methanol is effective, it can sometimes lead to peptide denaturation; hence, careful control of concentration and exposure time is maintained to mitigate this risk.\n\n4. **Potential Issues and Mitigations**:\n   - **Sample Loss**: If analyte breakthrough occurs, we will adjust the dispense rate or volume based on preliminary results to ensure optimal retention. For example, if initial trials indicate breakthrough, reducing the dispense rate can enhance retention.\n   - **Insufficient Elution**: Should elution prove inadequate, we will consider increasing the eluting solution volume or altering the solvent composition to enhance recovery. For instance, adding a small percentage of water to methanol can sometimes improve elution efficiency.\n   - These proactive strategies ensure that the experiment remains on track and achieves its objectives.\n\n5. **Simplification and Clarity**:\n   - The explanation of each step is kept concise, focusing on the critical aspects that directly impact the experiment's success. This ensures clarity and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n\n6. **Adherence to Agenda**:\n   - The protocol is designed to be feasible within the 3-month timeframe, with each step optimized for efficiency. Regular checkpoints will be established to assess progress and make necessary adjustments, ensuring timely completion.\n\n7. **Decision Points**:\n   - Decision points are integrated into the protocol, allowing for adjustments based on initial results. For example, if purity thresholds are not met, we will revisit the washing or elution steps to optimize conditions. Criteria such as achieving >95% purity and recovery rates above 80% will guide these adjustments.\n\nBy incorporating these detailed justifications and addressing potential issues, the experiment setup aligns more closely with the agenda's goals, ensuring a robust and scientifically impactful application of machine learning in drug discovery."
