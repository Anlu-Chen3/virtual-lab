ExperimentHPLC[Samples]⟹Protocol

generates a Protocol to separate Samples via high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).



High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) involves an aqueous and/or organic mobile phase, into which, samples are injected and flowed through the stationary phase column. Analytes pass over resin within the column and selectively adsorb based on their relative affinity, leading to differential retention of unique analyte molecules. Molecules are carried downstream for chemical property analysis and optional collection. On the whole, molecular components are separated into analyzable, collectable constituents. For instance, synthesized DNA can be purified based on the total ionic charge of each unique strand.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a HPLC experiment. Step 1: If ConductivityCalibration -> True, the conductance probe is calibrated and the conductance flow cell is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 2: If pHCalibration -> True, the pH probe is calibrated and the pH flow cell is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 3: During the system prime, the system is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 4: The stationary Column is installed and equilibrated to measurement conditions. Step 5: Samples are then introduced into the flow path. Step 6: The analytes are selectively retained on the downstream Column. Step 7: Upon exit from the column, the now separated analytes are analyzed according to their physical property. Step 8: Based on the property measurement and specifications, analytes are saved in output containers, if CollectFractions ->True. Step 9: After final sample measurement, the Column is rinsed, removed from the system, and stowed. Step 10: After the column is removed the system is rinsed with cleaning solution.



Instrumentation

Waters Acquity UPLC H-Class PDA

Model[Instrument, HPLC, "id:Z1lqpMGJmR0O"]

Figure 2.1.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems. Buffer solutions (up to 4) are steadily pumped through the instrument, consisting of a 6-port valve system, adsorbent column, detectors, and terminates at fraction collection or waste. Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column. Within the column, molecular constituents are separated by adsorption -- a function of the buffers, column, sample properties and temperature. Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals.

Figure 2.1.2: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.

The light of the user-selected wavelength is used to excite the flow downstream of the column. The excitation light stimulates the sample to emit fluorescence light. After it is focused by the lens, the emission light is filtered with an emission monochromator to select the light of the user-selected wavelength. A cut-off filter, which lets only light above a certain wavelength pass, is located before the emission monochromator to achieve even better sensitivity. Finally, the filtered emission light is measured with a double-photomultiplier tube (PMT) system to cover the full spectra range from ultraviolet to near-infrared region (220 – 900 nm).

Figure 2.7.3: Principle of Multi-Angle static Light Scattering (MALS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) detection. The flow downstream of the column passes through the MALS detector, which is equipped with the DLS detection module. 658 nm laser light is scattered by the nanoparticles or biomacromolecules in the sample inside the flow cell. The intensities of the scattered light beams at different directions are measured by 17 MALS photodiode detectors. Meanwhile, the fluctuation of the scattered light beam is measured by 1 DLS photodiode detector. The DLS photodiode detector has smaller surface area than the MALS photodiode detector to allow accurate measurement of light intensity fluctuation. With the concentration information of the sample, the results from MALS and DLS detection can provide analysis of molar mass, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius for copolymers and protein conjugates (glycoproteins, PEGylated proteins, surfactant-bound membrane proteins, etc).

Figure 2.7.4: Principle of refractive index (RI) detection.There are two flow cells inside the RI detector: sample flow cell and reference flow cell.When the reference loading valves are open, the flow downstream of the column is loaded into the two flow cells simultaneously. When the valves are closed,only the sample flow cell is loaded while the reference flow remains stable.The light source of 600 nm passes through the sample flow cell and then the reference flow cell and the refracted light is measured by a photodiode.Under RefractiveIndex mode,the valves are kept open and both flow cells are loaded with the sample.The displacement of the light beam is measured and used to determine the absolute refractive index of the sample. Under DifferentialRefractiveIndex mode,the reference cell is loaded with the desired solvent at the beginning of the experiment and then the valves are closed.The shift of light beam direction is measured and used to determine the differential refractive index of the sample and the solvent.

Figure 2.8.3: Principle of pH and conductivity detection. The flow downstream of the column passes through the conductivity flow cell and the pH flow cell sequentially. Conductivity is monitored with the resulting amperometric signals while alternating voltage is applied on the conductivity probe. pH is measured by the generated voltage between the working electrode and the reference electrode, which is directly proportional to the pH of the solution in the pH flow cell. Temperature sensors are presented in both flow cells to achieve automatic temperature compensation in the pH and conductivity calculation.

Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals. Separated analytes can be collected based on the properties of these resulting peaks.

Figure 2.9.2: Agilent 1290 Infinity plumbing diagram. The solvent flow from each pump head is merged at a t-piece in pairs. Solvents A/C share the same flow path from here on as well as B/D. Joint flow from from each pump pair then travels through a pressure sensor and a purge valve before it is combined at the manifold where it then moves on to the mixer and an autosampler. This configuration does not allow for having a gradient of A/C or B/D and only mixes between the two sides are possible.

Figure 2.9.3: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.

Example Calls

Basics

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separates sample mixtures into analyzable molecular constituents by injection into flowing liquid that passes through a retentive column:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples]

Separation Mode and Gradient

Various modalities are available to elicit separation in HPLC including changing the composition of the buffers over time. For example, often ReversePhase is used to separate a mixture of polar and non-polar compounds. ReversePhase entails using a non-polar resin in the Column and linearly changing the mobile phase from polar to non-polar, solvating moieties adsorbed to the column. To run a ReversePhase separation, simply run:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, SeparationMode -> ReversePhase]

More specific buffers and gradient profiles can also be articulated. For example:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples,

 	BufferB -> Model[Sample, "Methanol - LCMS grade"],

 	GradientB -> {

   		{0 * Minute, 5 * Percent},

   		{20 * Minute, 40 * Percent}

   	}

 ]

Standards and Blanks

ExperimentHPLC can be used to quantify analytes in a sample, in which case, a Standard sample is employed to serve as reference. A standard can be submitted before and after the injection sequence of the samples simply by running:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast]

Likewise, a Blank sample can be used to see if there is any background from the injection process. To run a blank to occur between every 5 samples, use the following command:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, BlankFrequency -> 5]

Fraction Collection

ExperimentHPLC can physically collect the separated analytes, based on the properties of the resulting detection signal. To turn this option on, run the following command:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, CollectFractions -> True]

Parameters can be set to control the triggering of FractionCollection. Here fractions are collected from peaks that exceed a minimum absorbance value:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples,

 AbsoluteThreshold -> (50 * Milli * AbsorbanceUnit)]

FractionCollectionDetector can be set to trigger fraction collection based on the peaks in the desired channel:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, FractionCollectionDetector -> Fluorescence]

PhotoDiodeArray detection

PhotoDiodeArray detection involves passing light across a range of wavelengths and measuring how much light is absorbed by the sample at each even wavelength. To run a PhotoDiodeArray HPLC experiment, simply run:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> PhotoDiodeArray]

The range of wavelengths can be set, and the UV light can be blocked if necessary:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples,

 	AbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[400, 500 * Nanometer],

 	UVFilter -> True

 ]

Fluorescence detection

Fluorescence detection involves the excitation of the mobile phase with light at defined wavelengths. Fluorescent moieties within the mobile phase will accordingly emit light, also measurable at defined wavelengths. Therefore, directly defining excitation and emission wavelengths is possible for successful measurement. To run a fluorescence HPLC experiment, simply run:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> Fluorescence]

Up to 4 pairs of excitation/emission wavelengths can be defined:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples,

 	ExcitationWavelength -> {485 * Nanometer, 515 * Nanometer},

 	EmissionWavelength -> {515 * Nanometer, 595 * Nanometer}

 ]

Evaporative Light Scattering detection

Evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) measurement forms dispersed droplets from the column effluent. The droplets are formed through nebulization, which is accomplished through a combination of heat and a sheath gas. Droplets containing analytes are different sizes, and this variability in droplet size is measurable through light scattering. The sheath gas carries the droplets through the heated drift tube for eventual scattering measurement. Accordingly, the ELSD measurement directly measures this light scattering over time of the measurement. An ELSD experiment can be executed by simply running:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> EvaporativeLightScattering]

ELSD provides detailed control over how the scattering functions, and the flow rate of the sheath gas and the temperature of the drift tube can be specified. For example, to increase the flow rate and control the temperature, the options may be specified as follows:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples,

 	NebulizerGasPressure -> (60 * PSI),

 	DriftTubeTemperature -> (55 * Celsius)

 ]

pH and conductance detection

pH and conductance detectors monitor the pH and conductance values of the flow in the HPLC system to verify elution conditions, sample retention behavior, and instrument precision during analysis:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> {pH, Conductance}]

pH and conductance measurements can be automatically corrected according to the temperatures inside the corresponding flow cells:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples,

 	pHTemperatureCompensation -> True,

 	ConductivityTemperatureCompensation -> True

 ]

Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detection

In the Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detector, laser light is scattered by the nanoparticles or biomacromolecules in the sample inside the flow cell and the intensities and fluctuation of the scattered light beams at different directions are measured. The results from MALS and DLS detection can provide analysis of molar mass, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius for copolymers and protein conjugates:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples,

 	Detector -> {MultiAngleLightScattering, DynamicLightScattering}

 ]

Refractive index (RI) detection

Refractive index detection involves the measurement of the shift of the light beam direction across the sample flow:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> RefractiveIndex]

RefractiveIndexMethod can be set to DifferentialRefractiveIndex to measure the refractive index difference between the sample and the reference (loaded in the previous gradient step) in order to determine the concentration of the sample:

ExperimentHPLC[mySamples,

 RefractiveIndexMethod -> DifferentialRefractiveIndex]

Injection Table

In addition to specifying the frequencies of running standards and blanks, the injection sequence of samples, standards, blanks, and column primes/flushes can be explicitly articulated. In the following example, an additional column flush is specified after the injection of the second sample:

customInjectionTable = {

   	{ColumnPrime, Null},

   	{Sample, mySample1},

   	{Blank, Model[Sample, "Milli-Q water"]},

   	{Sample, mySample2},

   	{ColumnFlush, Null},

   	{

    		Standard,

    		Model[Sample,

     			StockSolution, Standard,

     "Thermo-Fisher dsDNA Ladder 10-300 bp, 50 ng/uL"

     		]

    	},

   	{Sample, mySample3},

   	{ColumnFlush, Null}

   };

ExperimentHPLC[{mySample1, mySample2, mySample3},

 	InjectionTable -> customInjectionTable

 ]

 ]



Possible Issues

Equilibration

Equilibrate to the correct buffer conditions at the end of each gradient to reach a state that is appropriate for the start of the next gradient.

Column flush

The column will end up being stored in whatever the final gradient solvent conditions are so that should be considered for column protection.

Column fouling

Consider using a GuardColumn to preserve column lifetime. Examine injections of standards over time to ensure that the column is performing to satisfaction.

Filter sample and buffer

Samples should not have particulates; otherwise, the system will over-pressurize. Consider filtering any samples or buffers used for the HPLC experiment.

   **Answer**: Peptide-based therapeutics.

   **Justification**: Peptide-based therapeutics are chosen due to their compatibility with ECL's capabilities, allowing for efficient synthesis and validation. Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.

2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**

   **Answer**: 
   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor
   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1
   3. Alzheimer's Disease - Amyloid-beta
   4. Antimicrobial Resistance - MurA/B
   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9

   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.

3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**

   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.

2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.

3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.

4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.

5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights. Ensure all team members are aligned on objectives and timelines, maintaining thorough documentation and transparent communication.

By incorporating these detailed steps and justifications, we aim to achieve a project that maximizes both scientific impact and clinical relevance, leveraging machine learning and ECL's capabilities effectively within our constraints.
