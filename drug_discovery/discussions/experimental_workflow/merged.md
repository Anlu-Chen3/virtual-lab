### Revised Agenda Response

Our project aims to leverage machine learning for drug discovery, focusing on peptide-based therapeutics. The objectives are to ensure high clinical value, demonstrate a significant application of machine learning, and utilize Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation within a 3-month timeframe. Below is the refined experimental workflow for synthesizing and validating peptides, incorporating detailed feedback and improvements.

### Answers

1. **What experiments in order will you run to synthesize the peptides in preparation for validation?**

   **Answer**: 
   - **ExperimentPeptideSynthesis**
   - **ExperimentSolidPhaseExtraction**
   - **ExperimentHPLC**
   - **ExperimentMassSpectrometry**

   **Justification**: This sequence ensures efficient synthesis and purification. **ExperimentPeptideSynthesis** constructs the peptide sequences based on machine learning predictions using algorithms like neural networks and support vector machines to optimize sequence selection for target binding and stability. **ExperimentSolidPhaseExtraction** targets specific impurities like unreacted reagents and by-products. **ExperimentHPLC** further purifies peptides, ensuring they meet a purity threshold of >95%, determined based on historical data and computational predictions. **ExperimentMassSpectrometry** confirms molecular identity and purity, with a focus on achieving a mass accuracy within 0.1 Da of the predicted value.

2. **What is the role of each experiment in the synthesis workflow?**

   **Answer**: 
   - **ExperimentPeptideSynthesis**: Constructs peptide sequences using solid-phase synthesis, guided by computational predictions to optimize sequence selection for target binding and stability. Algorithms such as neural networks and support vector machines are used to predict sequence stability and binding affinity.
   - **ExperimentSolidPhaseExtraction**: Removes impurities such as unreacted reagents and by-products, ensuring initial purification.
   - **ExperimentHPLC**: Provides high-resolution purification, confirming that peptides meet the >95% purity threshold necessary for validation, a criterion based on historical data and computational predictions.
   - **ExperimentMassSpectrometry**: Confirms molecular identity and purity, ensuring mass accuracy within 0.1 Da of predicted values.

   **Justification**: Each experiment is critical for ensuring high-quality peptide synthesis, with specific criteria for success that align with machine learning predictions.

6. **What are the decision points for whether to proceed with further validation for each peptide?**

   **Answer**: 
   - **LCMS**: If purity and mass do not meet thresholds (>95% purity, mass accuracy within 0.1 Da), halt further validation.
   - **Circular Dichroism**: Improper folding or instability indicates stopping further validation.
   - **BioLayer Interferometry**: Low binding affinity (Kd >10 μM) suggests revisiting design before proceeding.
   - **Thermal Shift**: Insufficient thermal stability (Tm <50°C) indicates a need for redesign.
