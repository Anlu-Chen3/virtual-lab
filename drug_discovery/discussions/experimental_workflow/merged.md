This will involve using tools like Amazon S3 for data storage and Amazon SageMaker for model training and refinement. This setup will allow for continuous refinement of predictions and guide future experiments.

- **Timeline and Resource Management**: We will adhere to the 3-month experimental timeline by setting clear milestones, such as completing synthesis within the first month and validation within the subsequent two months. Contingency plans include allocating additional resources for critical experiments and scheduling regular progress reviews to ensure timely completion. If synthesis or validation falls behind schedule, we will prioritize key experiments and adjust resource allocation accordingly.

By incorporating these improvements, we ensure a detailed, aligned, and efficient workflow that maximizes the potential for impactful drug discovery outcomes within our constraints.
