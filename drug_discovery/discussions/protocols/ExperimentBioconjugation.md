ExperimentBioconjugation[SamplePools, NewIdentityModels]âŸ¹Protocol

generates a Protocol object to covalently bind SamplePools through chemical crosslinking to create a sample composed of NewIdentityModels. Bioconjugation reactions are a restricted form of synthesis where conjugations: 1) occur in aqueous solution, 2) occur at atmospheric conditions, 3) are low volume, 4) do not require slow addition of reagents, 5) and do not require reaction monitoring.



Bioconjugation chemically links molecules together where the resulting molecule takes on properties of all parent molecules. This procedure is typically used to modify proteins, antibodies, solid phase supports, and oligomers. Common conjugates are fluorophores, nanoparticles, biotin, and horseradish peroxidase. First, if necessary, the input sample is functionalized or activated to prepare covalent binding sites to accept the conjugate. The activated input sample is then incubated with the conjugates and a covalent bond is formed. The reaction can be quenched to deactivate any unreacted binding sites. Downstream purification may be used to separate conjugated samples from the reaction components prior to use in other assays.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Bioconjugation covalently binds a biomolecule to a molecule of interest. Optional Step 1: Biomolecules can be activated to prepare and expose binding sites prior to conjugation. Activation parameters can be used to specify the activation reagent (ActivationReagent, ActivationReagentVolume), mixing of the activation sample (ActivationMix, ActivationMixType, etc.), the incubation time (ActivationTime), the incubation temperature (ActivationTemperature), and any post activation washing if desired (PostActivationWash). Step 2: The conjugation samples are mixed (ConjugationMix, ConjugationMixType, etc) at the desired ratio incubated for the ConjugationTime at the ConjugationTemperature. During this step, covalent bonds are formed between the conjugation samples to create a new molecule characterized by properties of each individual conjugation molecule. Optional Step 3: Unreacted conjugates can be quenched using the QuenchReaction option to deactivate any reactive sites or inhibit the molecular properties of any unconjugated molecules. Step 4: The resulting conjugated molecule can be further purified using PostConjugationWorkup options or used in downstream assays. This process is ideal for small volume conjugations of antibodies, proteins, oligomers, and microbeads including xMap Luminex beads. All steps of this experiment use ExperimentSampleManipulation primitives such as Transfer, Incubate, Filter, and Pellet. For more information on options available in these primitives or to understand how ExperimentSampleManipulation works please see the corresponding help file.

Preferred Input Containers

The ReactionVessels in which samples are pooled and incubated to conjugate analytes. Any desired container may be used but small volume vessels and liquid handler containers are preferred.



Possible Issues

Samples not chemically linked

If the output sample does not contain chemically linked molecules evaluate whether functional groups on the input molecule react spontaneously or require activation. Use Activate-> True and related options should this be necessary.

Low yield of conjugated molecule.

If the output sample contains a low yield of conjugated particles consider optimizing the conjugation conditions including ConjugationTime, ConjugationTemperature, and ConjugationBuffer.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning for drug discovery. Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptide-based therapeutics for a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentBioconjugation protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentBioconjugation[<options>] where you fill in <options> with the appropriate options. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context. In general, leave most options at their default values (and therefore do not specify them) except for those options that should be changed based on your specific experimental design. For every option that you do specify, please explain why you chose that value.
