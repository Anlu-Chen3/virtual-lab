ExperimentNMR[Samples]âŸ¹Protocol

generates a Protocol object for measuring the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of provided Samples.



Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a spectroscopic technique used to identify and characterize the chemical structure of compounds. A sample is inserted into a magnetic field, which causes select nuclei (most commonly 1H and 13C) to absorb radio-frequency radiation. The frequency at which this occurs, and the intensity of this absorption, is proportional to the magnetic field around each nucleus. This magnetic field is heavily dependent on the chemical environment, and so each nucleus will give a characteristic signal depending on its surroundings. This produces a spectrum that allows identification of known molecules or the characterization of the structure of unknown ones.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Step 1: Sample is dissolved in specified NMRSolvent. Step 2: Samples are transferred into NMR tubes. Step 3: The tubes are loaded onto the NMR instrument. Step 4: The spectrum is collected for each of the samples. Step 5 (optional): The data is assessed using AnalyzePeaks.



Instrumentation

Ascend 500

Model[Instrument, NMR, "id:6V0npvK61r8q"]

Figure 2.1.1: Samples in NMR tubes are lowered into the bore of the NMR instrument. A superconducting magnet cooled by liquid helium generates a strong magnetic field (11.7 T) that surrounds the sample and aligns the spin states of its nuclei. A radio-frequency pulse is applied to the sample which excites the nuclear spin states of the desired nucleus. Once the pulse is turned off, the excited spins emit a decaying rf signal known as a free induction decay (FID) as they return to equilibrium. Because the environment of each nucleus differs, the nature of this FID allows for the characterization of the structure of the provided sample.

     "Multiplet (m)", "Singlet (s)", "Triplet (t)"}

   	],

 	PlotRange -> {{-0.5, 3.}, Automatic}

 ]



Possible Issues

Sample too concentrated

If too much sample is dissolved in too little solvent, the instrument may have a hard time locking onto the solvent's deuterium signal. This may cause substantial tailing in peaks.

Volume too small

If SolventVolume is set too low, the instrument may have trouble shimming. The resulting spectrum may show peak tailing and lower resolution. Recommended SolventVolume is at least 700 Î¼L.

[end summary 1]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning for drug discovery. Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptides that are designed to bind to a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentNMR protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentNMR[inputs] where you fill in "inputs" with the appropriate inputs. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context with example function calls and the full set of options for the experiment. In general, leave most options at their default values and therefore do not include them in your experiment function call. Only specify options that must be changed from their default value for your specific experiment. For every option that you specify, please state the default value, the different value you chose, and why you chose that value instead of the default.

Medicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda.
