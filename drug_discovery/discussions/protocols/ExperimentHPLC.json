Analytes pass over resin within the column and selectively adsorb based on their relative affinity, leading to differential retention of unique analyte molecules. Molecules are carried downstream for chemical property analysis and optional collection. On the whole, molecular components are separated into analyzable, collectable constituents. For instance, synthesized DNA can be purified based on the total ionic charge of each unique strand.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a HPLC experiment. Step 1: If ConductivityCalibration -> True, the conductance probe is calibrated and the conductance flow cell is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 2: If pHCalibration -> True, the pH probe is calibrated and the pH flow cell is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 3: During the system prime, the system is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 4: The stationary Column is installed and equilibrated to measurement conditions. Step 5: Samples are then introduced into the flow path. Step 6: The analytes are selectively retained on the downstream Column. Step 7: Upon exit from the column, the now separated analytes are analyzed according to their physical property. Step 8: Based on the property measurement and specifications, analytes are saved in output containers, if CollectFractions ->True. Step 9: After final sample measurement, the Column is rinsed, removed from the system, and stowed. Step 10: After the column is removed the system is rinsed with cleaning solution.\n\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\nWaters Acquity UPLC H-Class PDA\n\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:Z1lqpMGJmR0O\"]\n\nFigure 2.1.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems. Buffer solutions (up to 4) are steadily pumped through the instrument, consisting of a 6-port valve system, adsorbent column, detectors, and terminates at fraction collection or waste. Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column. Within the column, molecular constituents are separated by adsorption -- a function of the buffers, column, sample properties and temperature. Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals.\n\nFigure 2.1.2: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.\n\nWaters Acquity UPLC H-Class FLR\n\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:1ZA60vw8X5eD\"]\n\nFigure 2.2.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems.

The light beam from the Xenon lamp focused by the lens transmits through the excitation monochromator. The light of the user-selected wavelength is used to excite the flow downstream of the column. The excitation light stimulates the sample to emit fluorescence light. After it is focused by the lens, the emission light is filtered with an emission monochromator to select the light of the user-selected wavelength. A cut-off filter, which lets only light above a certain wavelength pass, is located before the emission monochromator to achieve even better sensitivity. Finally, the filtered emission light is measured with a double-photomultiplier tube (PMT) system to cover the full spectra range from ultraviolet to near-infrared region (220 \u2013 900 nm).\n\nUltiMate 3000 with MALS-DLS-RI Detector\n\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:M8n3rx098xbO\"]\n\nFigure 2.7.1: Instrument diagram for the Ultimate 3000 system.

Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak.\n\nFigure 2.7.3: Principle of Multi-Angle static Light Scattering (MALS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) detection. The flow downstream of the column passes through the MALS detector, which is equipped with the DLS detection module. 658 nm laser light is scattered by the nanoparticles or biomacromolecules in the sample inside the flow cell. The intensities of the scattered light beams at different directions are measured by 17 MALS photodiode detectors. Meanwhile, the fluctuation of the scattered light beam is measured by 1 DLS photodiode detector. The DLS photodiode detector has smaller surface area than the MALS photodiode detector to allow accurate measurement of light intensity fluctuation. With the concentration information of the sample, the results from MALS and DLS detection can provide analysis of molar mass, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius for copolymers and protein conjugates (glycoproteins, PEGylated proteins, surfactant-bound membrane proteins, etc).\n\nFigure 2.7.4: Principle of refractive index (RI) detection.There are two flow cells inside the RI detector: sample flow cell and reference flow cell.When the reference loading valves are open, the flow downstream of the column is loaded into the two flow cells simultaneously. When the valves are closed,only the sample flow cell is loaded while the reference flow remains stable.The light source of 600 nm passes through the sample flow cell and then the reference flow cell and the refracted light is measured by a photodiode.Under RefractiveIndex mode,the valves are kept open and both flow cells are loaded with the sample.The displacement of the light beam is measured and used to determine the absolute refractive index of the sample. Under DifferentialRefractiveIndex mode,the reference cell is loaded with the desired solvent at the beginning of the experiment and then the valves are closed.The shift of light beam direction is measured and used to determine the differential refractive index of the sample and the solvent.\n\nUltiMate 3000 with PCM Detector\n\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:P5ZnEjdExnnn\"]\n\nFigure 2.8.1: Instrument diagram for the Ultimate 3000 system.

Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak.\n\nFigure 2.8.3: Principle of pH and conductivity detection. The flow downstream of the column passes through the conductivity flow cell and the pH flow cell sequentially. Conductivity is monitored with the resulting amperometric signals while alternating voltage is applied on the conductivity probe. pH is measured by the generated voltage between the working electrode and the reference electrode, which is directly proportional to the pH of the solution in the pH flow cell. Temperature sensors are presented in both flow cells to achieve automatic temperature compensation in the pH and conductivity calculation.\n\nAgilent 1290 Infinity II LC System\n\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:R8e1Pjp1md8p\"]\n\nFigure 2.9.1: Instrument diagram for the Agilent 1290 Infinity system.

Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column.

Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals. Separated analytes can be collected based on the properties of these resulting peaks.\n\nFigure 2.9.2: Agilent 1290 Infinity plumbing diagram. The solvent flow from each pump head is merged at a t-piece in pairs. Solvents A/C share the same flow path from here on as well as B/D. Joint flow from from each pump pair then travels through a pressure sensor and a purge valve before it is combined at the manifold where it then moves on to the mixer and an autosampler. This configuration does not allow for having a gradient of A/C or B/D and only mixes between the two sides are possible.\n\nFigure 2.9.3: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nGeneral\n\nInstrument\n\nA list of one or more measurement and collection devices to run the experiment on and that satisfy the Scale and Detector options.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: For FractionCollection option specification and/or for Scale->Preparative or SemiPreparative, automatically set to instrument models that have fraction collection capabilities.

For example, often ReversePhase is used to separate a mixture of polar and non-polar compounds. ReversePhase entails using a non-polar resin in the Column and linearly changing the mobile phase from polar to non-polar, solvating moieties adsorbed to the column. To run a ReversePhase separation, simply run:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, SeparationMode -> ReversePhase]\n\nMore specific buffers and gradient profiles can also be articulated. For example:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n\n \tBufferB -> Model[Sample, \"Methanol - LCMS grade\"],\n\n \tGradientB -> {\n\n   \t\t{0 * Minute, 5 * Percent},\n\n   \t\t{20 * Minute, 40 * Percent}\n\n   \t}\n\n ]\n\nStandards and Blanks\n\nExperimentHPLC can be used to quantify analytes in a sample, in which case, a Standard sample is employed to serve as reference. A standard can be submitted before and after the injection sequence of the samples simply by running:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast]\n\nLikewise, a Blank sample can be used to see if there is any background from the injection process. To run a blank to occur between every 5 samples, use the following command:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, BlankFrequency -> 5]\n\nFraction Collection\n\nExperimentHPLC can physically collect the separated analytes, based on the properties of the resulting detection signal. To turn this option on, run the following command:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, CollectFractions -> True]\n\nParameters can be set to control the triggering of FractionCollection. Here fractions are collected from peaks that exceed a minimum absorbance value:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n\n AbsoluteThreshold -> (50 * Milli * AbsorbanceUnit)]\n\nFractionCollectionDetector can be set to trigger fraction collection based on the peaks in the desired channel:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, FractionCollectionDetector -> Fluorescence]\n\nPhotoDiodeArray detection\n\nPhotoDiodeArray detection involves passing light across a range of wavelengths and measuring how much light is absorbed by the sample at each even wavelength. To run a PhotoDiodeArray HPLC experiment, simply run:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> PhotoDiodeArray]\n\nThe range of wavelengths can be set, and the UV light can be blocked if necessary:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n\n \tAbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[400, 500 * Nanometer],\n\n \tUVFilter -> True\n\n ]\n\nFluorescence detection\n\nFluorescence detection involves the excitation of the mobile phase with light at defined wavelengths. Fluorescent moieties within the mobile phase will accordingly emit light, also measurable at defined wavelengths. Therefore, directly defining excitation and emission wavelengths is possible for successful measurement. To run a fluorescence HPLC experiment, simply run:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> Fluorescence]\n\nUp to 4 pairs of excitation/emission wavelengths can be defined:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n\n \tExcitationWavelength -> {485 * Nanometer, 515 * Nanometer},\n\n \tEmissionWavelength -> {515 * Nanometer, 595 * Nanometer}\n\n ]\n\nEvaporative Light Scattering detection\n\nEvaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) measurement forms dispersed droplets from the column effluent. The droplets are formed through nebulization, which is accomplished through a combination of heat and a sheath gas. Droplets containing analytes are different sizes, and this variability in droplet size is measurable through light scattering. The sheath gas carries the droplets through the heated drift tube for eventual scattering measurement. Accordingly, the ELSD measurement directly measures this light scattering over time of the measurement. An ELSD experiment can be executed by simply running:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> EvaporativeLightScattering]\n\nELSD provides detailed control over how the scattering functions, and the flow rate of the sheath gas and the temperature of the drift tube can be specified. For example, to increase the flow rate and control the temperature, the options may be specified as follows:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n\n \tNebulizerGasPressure -> (60 * PSI),\n\n \tDriftTubeTemperature -> (55 * Celsius)\n\n ]\n\npH and conductance detection\n\npH and conductance detectors monitor the pH and conductance values of the flow in the HPLC system to verify elution conditions, sample retention behavior, and instrument precision during analysis:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> {pH, Conductance}]\n\npH and conductance measurements can be automatically corrected according to the temperatures inside the corresponding flow cells:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n\n \tpHTemperatureCompensation -> True,\n\n \tConductivityTemperatureCompensation -> True\n\n ]\n\nMulti-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detection\n\nIn the Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detector, laser light is scattered by the nanoparticles or biomacromolecules in the sample inside the flow cell and the intensities and fluctuation of the scattered light beams at different directions are measured. The results from MALS and DLS detection can provide analysis of molar mass, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius for copolymers and protein conjugates:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n\n \tDetector -> {MultiAngleLightScattering, DynamicLightScattering}\n\n ]\n\nRefractive index (RI) detection\n\nRefractive index detection involves the measurement of the shift of the light beam direction across the sample flow:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> RefractiveIndex]\n\nRefractiveIndexMethod can be set to DifferentialRefractiveIndex to measure the refractive index difference between the sample and the reference (loaded in the previous gradient step) in order to determine the concentration of the sample:\n\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n\n RefractiveIndexMethod -> DifferentialRefractiveIndex]\n\nInjection Table\n\nIn addition to specifying the frequencies of running standards and blanks, the injection sequence of samples, standards, blanks, and column primes/flushes can be explicitly articulated. In the following example, an additional column flush is specified after the injection of the second sample:\n\ncustomInjectionTable = {\n\n   \t{ColumnPrime, Null},\n\n   \t{Sample, mySample1},\n\n   \t{Blank, Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"]},\n\n   \t{Sample, mySample2},\n\n   \t{ColumnFlush, Null},\n\n   \t{\n\n    \t\tStandard,\n\n    \t\tModel[Sample,\n\n     \t\t\tStockSolution, Standard,\n\n     \"Thermo-Fisher dsDNA Ladder 10-300 bp, 50 ng/uL\"\n\n     \t\t]\n\n    \t},\n\n   \t{Sample, mySample3},\n\n   \t{ColumnFlush, Null}\n\n   };\n\nExperimentHPLC[{mySample1, mySample2, mySample3},\n\n \tInjectionTable -> customInjectionTable\n\n ]\n\n\n\nPreferred Input Containers\n\nThe Watars H-Class instrument and Ultimate 3000 instrument autosamplers can take 2mL deep well plates.\n\nThe Watars H-Class instrument and Ultimate 3000 instrument autosamplers can take normal vials routinely used in HPLC analysis.\n\nThe Watars H-Class instrument and Ultimate 3000 instrument autosamplers can take normal vials routinely used in HPLC analysis.\n\nThe Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC System can take 50mL tubes.\n\nThe Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC System can take 15mL tubes.\n\n\n\nData Processing\n\nThe data can be viewed along with any existing peak selection:\n\nPlotChromatography[Object[Data, Chromatography, \"id:eGakld01dzk4\"]\n\nPeaks can be selected from the chromatography:\n\nAnalyzePeaksPreview[Object[Data, Chromatography, \"id:XnlV5jmbk0rn\"]]\n\nCollected fraction samples can be parsed and visualized on the chromatogram:\n\nPlotFractions[\n\n \tAnalyzeFractions[Object[Data, Chromatography, \"id:54n6evKxbxRB\"]]\n\n ]\n\n\n\nPossible Issues\n\nEquilibration\n\nEquilibrate to the correct buffer conditions at the end of each gradient to reach a state that is appropriate for the start of the next gradient.\n\nColumn flush\n\nThe column will end up being stored in whatever the final gradient solvent conditions are so that should be considered for column protection.\n\nColumn fouling\n\nConsider using a GuardColumn to preserve column lifetime. Examine injections of standards over time to ensure that the column is performing to satisfaction.\n\nFilter sample and buffer\n\nSamples should not have particulates; otherwise, the system will over-pressurize. Consider filtering any samples or buffers used for the HPLC experiment.\n\n[end context 1]\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\n### Comprehensive Protocol for Peptide Synthesis and Validation\n\nThis protocol integrates the best components from previous summaries to ensure a detailed, efficient, and scientifically rigorous approach to peptide synthesis and validation, aligned with the project's goals and constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Peptide Synthesis Protocol\n\n#### Step 1: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentPeptideSynthesis`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Fmoc-protected amino acids: 0.1 M in NMP, stored at 4\u00b0C\n  - Rink amide resin: 1 g, 0.1 mmol/g loading capacity\n  - Coupling reagents: HBTU (0.1 M in DMF), DIPEA (2 M in NMP)\n  - Deprotection agent: 20% piperidine in DMF, freshly prepared\n- **Equipment**: \n  - Automated peptide synthesizer, calibrated for accurate volume delivery\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Resin swelling in DMF for 30 minutes\n  - Coupling: 5 mL amino acid solution, 5 mL HBTU, 2 mL DIPEA, stir for 60 minutes\n  - Deprotection: 10 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 minutes, repeated\n  - Washing: Three washes with 10 mL DMF after each step\n- **Output**: Peptide-resin with confirmed coupling efficiency via HPLC\n\n**Quality Control**:\n- **Coupling Check**: Perform Kaiser test after each coupling step\n- **Documentation**: Record reagent batch numbers, conditions, and deviations\n\n#### Step 2: Cleavage and Deprotection\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentCleavage`\n- **Inputs**:\n  - Cleavage cocktail: TFA:water:triisopropylsilane:ethyl methyl sulfide (95:2.5:1:1.5), 10 mL per gram of resin\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Cleavage at room temperature for 2-3 hours\n- **Output**: Crude peptide in solution\n\n#### Step 3: Purification\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentSolidPhaseExtraction` and `ExperimentHPLC`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Crude peptide solution\n  - Solvent system: 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile-water gradient\n- **Equipment**: \n  - SPE apparatus and HPLC system with C18 column\n- **Conditions**: \n  - SPE: Gradient from 5% to 95% acetonitrile over 30 minutes\n  - HPLC: Flow rate 1 mL/min, UV detection at 214 nm\n- **Output**: Purified peptide >90% purity\n\n#### Step 4: Mass Confirmation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentLCMS`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Purified peptide\n- **Equipment**: \n  - LC-MS system\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Standard LCMS settings for peptide analysis\n- **Output**: Confirmed molecular weight and sequence identity\n\n#### Step 5: Chemical Modifications\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentBioconjugation`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Purified peptide (0.4 mmol)\n  - PEG reagent (0.48 mmol)\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Room temperature, stirring for 2 hours in PBS\n- **Output**: Modified peptide, confirmed by MS\n\n### Peptide Validation Protocol\n\n#### Structural Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentNMR` and `ExperimentCircularDichroism`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - PBS buffer (pH 7.4)\n- **Equipment**: \n  - NMR spectrometer and CD spectrometer\n- **Conditions**: \n  - NMR: Proton and COSY 2D in DMSO-d6\n  - CD: 190-260 nm at 25\u00b0C\n- **Output**: Structural integrity and secondary structure confirmation\n\n#### Binding Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentBioLayerInterferometry` and `ExperimentFluorescencePolarization`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - Target protein: 1 mg/mL in PBS\n- **Equipment**: \n  - BLI instrument and fluorescence polarization reader\n- **Conditions**: \n  - BLI: Measure kinetics at peptide concentrations from 1 nM to 1 \u00b5M\n  - FP: Label peptide with FITC, measure binding across concentrations\n- **Output**: Binding affinity (expected KD <10 nM) and kinetic data\n\n#### Functional Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentELISA`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies\n- **Equipment**: \n  - ELISA plate reader\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Standard ELISA protocol\n- **Output**: Quantitative binding data\n\n#### Stability Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentThermalShift`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - Sypro Orange dye\n- **Equipment**: \n  - Real-time PCR thermal cycler\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Heat and record fluorescence to determine melting temperature\n- **Output**: Thermal stability profile\n\n### Integration with Machine Learning Models\n\n- **Data Handling and Feedback**: Collect binding affinity, structural data, and stability profiles to feed back into machine learning models (ProteinMPNN and RFDiffusion).

The gradient is tailored to achieve optimal separation within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n4. **Detector -> PhotoDiodeArray**:\n   - **Reason**: A photodiode array detector allows for the detection of absorbance across a range of wavelengths, providing comprehensive data on the peptide's absorption characteristics. This is essential for identifying and quantifying peptides.\n\n5. **AbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[200, 400 * Nanometer]**:\n   - **Reason**: This wavelength range covers the typical absorbance spectrum for peptides, ensuring that we capture relevant data for analysis.\n\n6. **CollectFractions -> True**:\n   - **Reason**: Fraction collection is necessary to isolate and collect the separated peptides for further analysis or use. This step is critical for subsequent validation experiments.\n\n7. **FractionCollectionDetector -> PhotoDiodeArray**:\n   - **Reason**: Using the same detector for fraction collection ensures consistency in detection and collection based on the absorbance peaks.\n\n8. **AbsoluteThreshold -> (50 * Milli * AbsorbanceUnit)**:\n   - **Reason**: Setting an absolute threshold ensures that only significant peaks are collected, reducing the risk of collecting noise or irrelevant fractions.\n\n9. **StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast**:\n   - **Reason**: Running standards at the beginning and end of the sequence helps verify the consistency and accuracy of the HPLC system throughout the experiment.\n\n10. **BlankFrequency -> 5**:\n    - **Reason**: Injecting blanks every five samples helps monitor for any carryover or contamination, ensuring the reliability of the results.\n\nThis setup is designed to efficiently separate, detect, and collect peptide fractions, aligning with our goals of high clinical value and scientifically impactful applications. The use of ECL ensures that the experiment is conducted with precision and reproducibility within the 3-month timeframe."
