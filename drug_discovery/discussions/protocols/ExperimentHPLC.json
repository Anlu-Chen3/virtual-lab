Analytes pass over resin within the column and selectively adsorb based on their relative affinity, leading to differential retention of unique analyte molecules. Molecules are carried downstream for chemical property analysis and optional collection. On the whole, molecular components are separated into analyzable, collectable constituents. For instance, synthesized DNA can be purified based on the total ionic charge of each unique strand.\n\nExperimental Principles\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a HPLC experiment. Step 1: If ConductivityCalibration -> True, the conductance probe is calibrated and the conductance flow cell is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 2: If pHCalibration -> True, the pH probe is calibrated and the pH flow cell is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 3: During the system prime, the system is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 4: The stationary Column is installed and equilibrated to measurement conditions. Step 5: Samples are then introduced into the flow path. Step 6: The analytes are selectively retained on the downstream Column. Step 7: Upon exit from the column, the now separated analytes are analyzed according to their physical property. Step 8: Based on the property measurement and specifications, analytes are saved in output containers, if CollectFractions ->True. Step 9: After final sample measurement, the Column is rinsed, removed from the system, and stowed. Step 10: After the column is removed the system is rinsed with cleaning solution.\n\nInstrumentation\nWaters Acquity UPLC H-Class PDA\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:Z1lqpMGJmR0O\"]\nFigure 2.1.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems. Buffer solutions (up to 4) are steadily pumped through the instrument, consisting of a 6-port valve system, adsorbent column, detectors, and terminates at fraction collection or waste. Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column. Within the column, molecular constituents are separated by adsorption -- a function of the buffers, column, sample properties and temperature. Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals.\nFigure 2.1.2: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.\nWaters Acquity UPLC H-Class FLR\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:1ZA60vw8X5eD\"]\nFigure 2.2.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems.

The light beam from the Xenon lamp focused by the lens transmits through the excitation monochromator. The light of the user-selected wavelength is used to excite the flow downstream of the column. The excitation light stimulates the sample to emit fluorescence light. After it is focused by the lens, the emission light is filtered with an emission monochromator to select the light of the user-selected wavelength. A cut-off filter, which lets only light above a certain wavelength pass, is located before the emission monochromator to achieve even better sensitivity. Finally, the filtered emission light is measured with a double-photomultiplier tube (PMT) system to cover the full spectra range from ultraviolet to near-infrared region (220 \u2013 900 nm).\nUltiMate 3000 with MALS-DLS-RI Detector\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:M8n3rx098xbO\"]\nFigure 2.7.1: Instrument diagram for the Ultimate 3000 system.

The flow downstream of the column passes through the MALS detector, which is equipped with the DLS detection module. 658 nm laser light is scattered by the nanoparticles or biomacromolecules in the sample inside the flow cell. The intensities of the scattered light beams at different directions are measured by 17 MALS photodiode detectors. Meanwhile, the fluctuation of the scattered light beam is measured by 1 DLS photodiode detector. The DLS photodiode detector has smaller surface area than the MALS photodiode detector to allow accurate measurement of light intensity fluctuation. With the concentration information of the sample, the results from MALS and DLS detection can provide analysis of molar mass, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius for copolymers and protein conjugates (glycoproteins, PEGylated proteins, surfactant-bound membrane proteins, etc).\nFigure 2.7.4: Principle of refractive index (RI) detection.There are two flow cells inside the RI detector: sample flow cell and reference flow cell.When the reference loading valves are open, the flow downstream of the column is loaded into the two flow cells simultaneously. When the valves are closed,only the sample flow cell is loaded while the reference flow remains stable.The light source of 600 nm passes through the sample flow cell and then the reference flow cell and the refracted light is measured by a photodiode.Under RefractiveIndex mode,the valves are kept open and both flow cells are loaded with the sample.The displacement of the light beam is measured and used to determine the absolute refractive index of the sample. Under DifferentialRefractiveIndex mode,the reference cell is loaded with the desired solvent at the beginning of the experiment and then the valves are closed.The shift of light beam direction is measured and used to determine the differential refractive index of the sample and the solvent.\nUltiMate 3000 with PCM Detector\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:P5ZnEjdExnnn\"]\nFigure 2.8.1: Instrument diagram for the Ultimate 3000 system.

Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak.\nFigure 2.8.3: Principle of pH and conductivity detection. The flow downstream of the column passes through the conductivity flow cell and the pH flow cell sequentially. Conductivity is monitored with the resulting amperometric signals while alternating voltage is applied on the conductivity probe. pH is measured by the generated voltage between the working electrode and the reference electrode, which is directly proportional to the pH of the solution in the pH flow cell. Temperature sensors are presented in both flow cells to achieve automatic temperature compensation in the pH and conductivity calculation.\nAgilent 1290 Infinity II LC System\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:R8e1Pjp1md8p\"]\nFigure 2.9.1: Instrument diagram for the Agilent 1290 Infinity system.

Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column.

Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals. Separated analytes can be collected based on the properties of these resulting peaks.\nFigure 2.9.2: Agilent 1290 Infinity plumbing diagram. The solvent flow from each pump head is merged at a t-piece in pairs. Solvents A/C share the same flow path from here on as well as B/D. Joint flow from from each pump pair then travels through a pressure sensor and a purge valve before it is combined at the manifold where it then moves on to the mixer and an autosampler. This configuration does not allow for having a gradient of A/C or B/D and only mixes between the two sides are possible.\nFigure 2.9.3: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.\n\nExperiment Options\nGeneral\nInstrument\nA list of one or more measurement and collection devices to run the experiment on and that satisfy the Scale and Detector options.\nDefault Value: Automatic\nDefault Calculation: For FractionCollection option specification and/or for Scale->Preparative or SemiPreparative, automatically set to instrument models that have fraction collection capabilities.

For example, often ReversePhase is used to separate a mixture of polar and non-polar compounds. ReversePhase entails using a non-polar resin in the Column and linearly changing the mobile phase from polar to non-polar, solvating moieties adsorbed to the column. To run a ReversePhase separation, simply run:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, SeparationMode -> ReversePhase]\nMore specific buffers and gradient profiles can also be articulated. For example:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n \tBufferB -> Model[Sample, \"Methanol - LCMS grade\"],\n \tGradientB -> {\n   \t\t{0 * Minute, 5 * Percent},\n   \t\t{20 * Minute, 40 * Percent}\n   \t}\n ]\nStandards and Blanks\nExperimentHPLC can be used to quantify analytes in a sample, in which case, a Standard sample is employed to serve as reference. A standard can be submitted before and after the injection sequence of the samples simply by running:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast]\nLikewise, a Blank sample can be used to see if there is any background from the injection process. To run a blank to occur between every 5 samples, use the following command:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, BlankFrequency -> 5]\nFraction Collection\nExperimentHPLC can physically collect the separated analytes, based on the properties of the resulting detection signal. To turn this option on, run the following command:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, CollectFractions -> True]\nParameters can be set to control the triggering of FractionCollection. Here fractions are collected from peaks that exceed a minimum absorbance value:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n AbsoluteThreshold -> (50 * Milli * AbsorbanceUnit)]\nFractionCollectionDetector can be set to trigger fraction collection based on the peaks in the desired channel:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, FractionCollectionDetector -> Fluorescence]\nPhotoDiodeArray detection\nPhotoDiodeArray detection involves passing light across a range of wavelengths and measuring how much light is absorbed by the sample at each even wavelength. To run a PhotoDiodeArray HPLC experiment, simply run:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> PhotoDiodeArray]\nThe range of wavelengths can be set, and the UV light can be blocked if necessary:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n \tAbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[400, 500 * Nanometer],\n \tUVFilter -> True\n ]\nFluorescence detection\nFluorescence detection involves the excitation of the mobile phase with light at defined wavelengths. Fluorescent moieties within the mobile phase will accordingly emit light, also measurable at defined wavelengths. Therefore, directly defining excitation and emission wavelengths is possible for successful measurement. To run a fluorescence HPLC experiment, simply run:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> Fluorescence]\nUp to 4 pairs of excitation/emission wavelengths can be defined:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n \tExcitationWavelength -> {485 * Nanometer, 515 * Nanometer},\n \tEmissionWavelength -> {515 * Nanometer, 595 * Nanometer}\n ]\nEvaporative Light Scattering detection\nEvaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) measurement forms dispersed droplets from the column effluent. The droplets are formed through nebulization, which is accomplished through a combination of heat and a sheath gas. Droplets containing analytes are different sizes, and this variability in droplet size is measurable through light scattering. The sheath gas carries the droplets through the heated drift tube for eventual scattering measurement. Accordingly, the ELSD measurement directly measures this light scattering over time of the measurement. An ELSD experiment can be executed by simply running:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> EvaporativeLightScattering]\nELSD provides detailed control over how the scattering functions, and the flow rate of the sheath gas and the temperature of the drift tube can be specified. For example, to increase the flow rate and control the temperature, the options may be specified as follows:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n \tNebulizerGasPressure -> (60 * PSI),\n \tDriftTubeTemperature -> (55 * Celsius)\n ]\npH and conductance detection\npH and conductance detectors monitor the pH and conductance values of the flow in the HPLC system to verify elution conditions, sample retention behavior, and instrument precision during analysis:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> {pH, Conductance}]\npH and conductance measurements can be automatically corrected according to the temperatures inside the corresponding flow cells:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n \tpHTemperatureCompensation -> True,\n \tConductivityTemperatureCompensation -> True\n ]\nMulti-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detection\nIn the Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detector, laser light is scattered by the nanoparticles or biomacromolecules in the sample inside the flow cell and the intensities and fluctuation of the scattered light beams at different directions are measured. The results from MALS and DLS detection can provide analysis of molar mass, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius for copolymers and protein conjugates:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n \tDetector -> {MultiAngleLightScattering, DynamicLightScattering}\n ]\nRefractive index (RI) detection\nRefractive index detection involves the measurement of the shift of the light beam direction across the sample flow:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples, Detector -> RefractiveIndex]\nRefractiveIndexMethod can be set to DifferentialRefractiveIndex to measure the refractive index difference between the sample and the reference (loaded in the previous gradient step) in order to determine the concentration of the sample:\nExperimentHPLC[mySamples,\n RefractiveIndexMethod -> DifferentialRefractiveIndex]\nInjection Table\nIn addition to specifying the frequencies of running standards and blanks, the injection sequence of samples, standards, blanks, and column primes/flushes can be explicitly articulated.

Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptide-based therapeutics for a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentHPLC protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentHPLC[<options>] where you fill in <options> with the appropriate options. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context. In general, leave most options at their default values (and therefore do not specify them) except for those options that should be changed based on your specific experimental design. For every option that you do specify, please explain why you chose that value.\n\nMedicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To implement the `ExperimentHPLC` protocol using ECL for the synthesis and validation of peptide-based therapeutics, we need to carefully select the options that align with our experimental design and objectives. Below is the proposed experiment setup, along with explanations for each specified option:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentHPLC[\n  SeparationMode -> ReversePhase,\n  BufferB -> Model[Sample, \"Methanol - LCMS grade\"],\n  GradientB -> {\n    {0 * Minute, 5 * Percent},\n    {20 * Minute, 40 * Percent}\n  },\n  Detector -> PhotoDiodeArray,\n  AbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[200, 400 * Nanometer],\n  CollectFractions -> True,\n  FractionCollectionDetector -> PhotoDiodeArray,\n  AbsoluteThreshold -> (50 * Milli * AbsorbanceUnit),\n  StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast,\n  BlankFrequency -> 5\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **SeparationMode -> ReversePhase**: \n   - **Reason**: Reverse-phase chromatography is ideal for separating peptides due to their varying polarities. This mode uses a non-polar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase, which is suitable for our peptide-based therapeutics.\n\n2. **BufferB -> Model[Sample, \"Methanol - LCMS grade\"]**:\n   - **Reason**: Methanol is a common organic solvent used in reverse-phase HPLC. It helps in eluting peptides by gradually increasing the organic content in the mobile phase.\n\n3. **GradientB -> { {0 * Minute, 5 * Percent}, {20 * Minute, 40 * Percent} }**:\n   - **Reason**: This gradient is designed to provide a gradual increase in methanol concentration, allowing for effective separation of peptide components over time.\n\n4. **Detector -> PhotoDiodeArray**:\n   - **Reason**: A photodiode array detector allows for the detection of multiple wavelengths simultaneously, which is beneficial for identifying and quantifying different peptide components based on their UV absorbance.\n\n5. **AbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[200, 400 * Nanometer]**:\n   - **Reason**: This wavelength range covers the typical absorbance maxima for peptides, ensuring that we capture the relevant absorbance signals for our analysis.\n\n6. **CollectFractions -> True**:\n   - **Reason**: Fraction collection is necessary for isolating and further analyzing the separated peptide components, which is crucial for subsequent validation steps.\n\n7. **FractionCollectionDetector -> PhotoDiodeArray**:\n   - **Reason**: Using the same detector for fraction collection ensures consistency in detecting the peaks that trigger fraction collection.\n\n8. **AbsoluteThreshold -> (50 * Milli * AbsorbanceUnit)**:\n   - **Reason**: Setting an absolute threshold ensures that only significant peaks are collected, reducing the collection of noise or irrelevant fractions.\n\n9. **StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast**:\n   - **Reason**: Running standards at the beginning and end of the sequence helps in verifying the consistency and accuracy of the HPLC system throughout the experiment.\n\n10. **BlankFrequency -> 5**:\n    - **Reason**: Including a blank every five samples helps in monitoring and correcting for any background noise or contamination that may occur during the experiment.\n\nBy implementing these options, we ensure that the HPLC experiment is tailored to effectively separate, detect, and collect peptide components, aligning with our project's goals of high clinical value and scientific impact. This setup will be executed using ECL to ensure precise and reliable experimental validation within the 3-month timeframe."
