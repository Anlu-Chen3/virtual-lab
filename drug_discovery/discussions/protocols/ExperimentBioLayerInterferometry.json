Binding of the analyte is monitored by the change in thickness of the bound bio-layer on the tip of a fiber-optic probe, which is determined by the white-light interference pattern of a reference channel and the bio-layer/solution interface. Probe tips can be functionalized via immersion in a solution of the target immobilized species and regenerated to return either a loading ready or measurement ready surface. After appropriate treatment, the probes are dipped into a sample solution to quantify the analyte concentration or to determine the association and dissociation kinetics. Other common experiments include epitope binning and assay optimization. Biolayer interferometry is useful for studying a variety of interactions involving proteins, oligomers, small molecules, fragments, and antibodies, and can be performed on crude samples such as cell lysate.\n\nExperimental Principles\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a Biolayer Interferometry experiment. Step 1: The assay plate is loaded with buffers, loading solutions, standards, analytes, and other types of solutions required for the desired assay. Step 2: The probes are loaded into the probe rack position, where they may be immersed in equilibration solution prior to and during the course of the assay. Step 3: The multi-channel reader probes are immersed in an assay plate column to load the probe surface with an immobilized species (ActivateSurface, LoadSurface, Quench), measure the analyte binding properties (MeasureAssociation, MeasureDissocaition, Quantitate), or return the probe to measurement-ready condition via regeneration (Regenerate, Neutralize, Wash). Step 4: Any solutions derived from a given sample can be recovered from the AssayPlate.\n\nInstrumentation\nOctet Red96e\nModel[Instrument, BioLayerInterferometer, \"id:xRO9n3Bw9ZRq\"]\nFigure 2.1.1: Fiber-optic probes are stored in the probe rack position, either dry or immersed in a buffer solution. An 8-channel manifold moves between the probe rack and assay plate positions to pick up probes and conduct measurements via immersion in wells of a given column in the assay plate. A plate cover can be used to cover columns of the assay plate not currently being measured by the 8-channel reader to prevent evaporation over the course of long assays. The white light input reflects off of the internal optical layer and the biolayer/solution interface, producing an interference pattern which is directly proportional to the biolayer thickness.\n\nExperiment Options\nGeneral\nInstrument\nThe device on which the bio-layer interferometry protocol is to be run.\nDefault Value: Model[Instrument, BioLayerInterferometer, Octet Red96e]\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Instrument, BioLayerInterferometer] or Object[Instrument, BioLayerInterferometer]\nProgrammatic Pattern: ObjectP[{Model[Instrument, BioLayerInterferometer], Object[Instrument, BioLayerInterferometer]}]\nExperimentType\nThe objective of bio-layer interferometry experiment.

        "message": "To implement the `ExperimentBioLayerInterferometry` protocol using ECL, we need to carefully select and specify the options that align with our experimental design for peptide-based therapeutics. Here is the proposed setup for the experiment, along with explanations for each specified option:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentBioLayerInterferometry[\n  ExperimentType -> Kinetics,\n  BioProbeType -> Model[Item, BLIProbe, ProA],\n  NumberOfRepeats -> 3,\n  AcquisitionRate -> 5*Hertz,\n  PlateCover -> True,\n  Temperature -> 25*Celsius,\n  DefaultBuffer -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, BLI Kinetics Buffer, 1X],\n  RegenerationType -> {Regenerate, Neutralize, Wash},\n  RegenerationSolution -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, \"2 M HCl\"],\n  NeutralizationSolution -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, \"Neutralization Buffer\"],\n  WashSolution -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, \"Wash Buffer\"],\n  MeasureAssociationTime -> 15*Minute,\n  MeasureDissociationTime -> 30*Minute,\n  KineticsSampleFixedDilutions -> Automatic,\n  KineticsSampleDiluent -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, BLI Kinetics Buffer, 1X],\n  SaveAssayPlate -> True\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **ExperimentType -> Kinetics**: We are interested in measuring the association and dissociation rates of the peptide with the target protein, which is crucial for understanding binding kinetics.\n\n2. **BioProbeType -> Model[Item, BLIProbe, ProA]**: This is a common probe type suitable for protein interactions, ensuring compatibility with our peptide-based assays.\n\n3. **NumberOfRepeats -> 3**: To ensure reproducibility and reliability of the data, we will repeat the assay three times.\n\n4. **AcquisitionRate -> 5*Hertz**: This rate balances data density with signal-to-noise ratio, suitable for most binding events.\n\n5. **PlateCover -> True**: Since the assay might run for extended periods, using a plate cover will prevent evaporation and maintain sample integrity.\n\n6. **Temperature -> 25*Celsius**: Conducting the experiment at a controlled temperature ensures consistency and reliability in kinetic measurements.\n\n7. **DefaultBuffer -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, BLI Kinetics Buffer, 1X]**: This buffer is optimized for kinetic assays, providing a stable environment for the interaction.\n\n8. **RegenerationType -> {Regenerate, Neutralize, Wash}**: This sequence ensures that the bio-probe is returned to a measurement-ready state after each cycle, allowing for multiple uses.\n\n9. **RegenerationSolution -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, \"2 M HCl\"]**: A strong acid is used to remove residual analyte from the probe surface effectively.\n\n10. **NeutralizationSolution -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, \"Neutralization Buffer\"]**: This solution neutralizes the probe surface after regeneration, preventing pH-induced alterations.\n\n11. **WashSolution -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, \"Wash Buffer\"]**: Ensures that any residual regeneration or neutralization solution is removed, maintaining probe integrity.\n\n12. **MeasureAssociationTime -> 15*Minute**: This duration is typically sufficient to observe the association phase of peptide-protein interactions.\n\n13. **MeasureDissociationTime -> 30*Minute**: A longer dissociation time allows for a detailed analysis of the peptide's binding stability.\n\n14. **KineticsSampleFixedDilutions -> Automatic**: Automatically generates a series of dilutions, facilitating a comprehensive kinetic analysis.\n\n15. **KineticsSampleDiluent -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, BLI Kinetics Buffer, 1X]**: Ensures consistent dilution conditions, maintaining the integrity of the kinetic measurements.\n\n16. **SaveAssayPlate -> True**: Saving the assay plate allows for potential re-analysis or further experiments if needed.\n\nBy setting these options, we align the experimental setup with our goals of understanding peptide-protein interactions, ensuring high-quality data for subsequent analysis and model refinement."
