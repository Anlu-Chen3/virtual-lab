After separation, analytes are ionized, selected, and detected in the Mass Spectrometer device (see ExperimentMassSpectrometry). Within, ions are resolved by their mass versus charge state. Optionally, ions can be fragmented by collision with an inert gas, and the resulting product ions can, in turn, be resolved and detected for more information. In total, LC-MS can answer composition questions; for example, proteins, lipids, and metabolites can be identified in a sample. Furthermore, LC-MS can answer concentration questions; for instance, nucleotides can be quantified in a biological sample.\n\nExperimental Principles\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a LCMS experiment. Step 1: The system is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 2: The stationary column is installed and equilibrated to measurement conditions. Step 3: Samples are then introduced into the flow path. Step 4: The analytes are selectively retained on the downstream column. Step 5: Upon exit from the column, the now separated analytes are analyzed according to their physical property using a mass spectrometer. Step 6: After final sample measurement, the Column(s) are rinsed, removed from the system, and stowed. Step 7: After the column is removed, the system is rinsed with cleaning solution.\n\nInstrumentation\nWaters Acquity UPLC I-Class PDA\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:4pO6dM5lRrl7\"]\nFigure 2.1.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems. Buffer solutions (up to 4) are steadily pumped through the instrument, consisting of a 6-port valve system, adsorbent column, detectors, and terminates at fraction collection or waste. Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column. Within the column, molecular constituents are separated by adsorption -- a function of the buffers, column, sample properties and temperature. Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals.\nFigure 2.1.2: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.\nXevo G2-XS QTOF\nModel[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, \"id:aXRlGn6KaWdO\"]\nFigure 2.2.1: Principles of an electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (QTOF). Analytes are flowed through a capillary tube into a heated source box (SourceTemeprature) at the desired InfusionFlowRate. A confluence of the source box temperature, DesolvationTemperature, DesolvationGasFlow, and ESICapillaryVolage result in neubilization, vaporization, and ionization of the analyte stream to generate an electrospray. The electrospray enters the mass spectrometer through the source cone, which serves to focus the ions and excludes contimation via a ConeGasFlow. Within the mass spectrometer, the electrospray is futher refined via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage) to yeild isolated gas-phase ions. Ions are then focused through a stepwave ion guide path via another applied voltage (StepwaveVoltage) into an ion beam. The ions travel through a quadrupole and a collision cell. Lastly, they enter a time-of-flight analyzer which resolves the ions by their mass to charge ratio according to their travel time. Spectra are continuously acquired for ions inside MassDetection hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration. For time independent samples, an average mass spectrum is generated. When coupled with liquid chromatography (see ExperimentLCMS) time-dependent mass spectra are generated instead.\nQTRAP 6500\nModel[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, \"id:N80DNj1aROOD\"]\nFigure 2.3.1: Principles of an electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-QQQ). Analytes are injected through the capillary tube into the source block at the desired InfusionFlowRate. Once the sample enters the source block, it is evaporated at the DesolvationTemperature under a stream of nitrogen gas with a pressure of DesolvationGasFlow. ESICapillaryVoltage is then applied to the capillary tubing tip to produce an electrospray, which turns into single gas-phase ions due to additional evaporation and desolvation SourceTemperature. Ions, focused by the ConeGasFlow, enter the mass spectrometer through the source cone and follow the ion path via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage). They are then guided through an ion guide path via another applied voltage (IonGuideVoltange) to generate a focused ion beam. Ions travel through the first quadrupole mass analyzer (MS1), where their mass is resolved by their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z, MassDetection). After the MS1, ions enter the collision cell, where they can be fragmented by collision-induced dissociation, resulting in bond breakage and the fragmentation of the molecular ions into smaller fragments. CollisionCellExitVoltage accelerates and guides the fragmented ions to enter the second quadrupole mass analyzer (MS2), where their mass can be resolved again by their m/z (FragmentMassDetection). Spectra are continuously acquired for ions either inside MassDetection as a ranged value or as a fixed value, hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration, and a total mass spectrum is generated.\n\nExperiment Options\nGeneral\nSeparationMode\nThe category of method used to elicit differential column retention due to interaction between molecules in the mobile phase with those on the stationary phase (column).\nDefault Value: Automatic\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to match the Separation Mode listed with the provided column.\nPattern Description: NormalPhase, ReversePhase, IonExchange, SizeExclusion, Affinity, or Chiral.\nProgrammatic Pattern: SeparationModeP | Automatic\nMassAnalyzer\nThe manner of detection used to resolve and detect molecules.

The top ranking intact ions are noted, then for each consequent scan of the cycle, a ranking intact ion is fragmented, and the resultant fragment ions are resolved and measured on the quadrupole time of flight. A suite of options are available to control how many ions are ranked, which ones are, and to eliminate redundancies.

In SelectedIonMonitoring, select MS1 masses (per the MassDetection option) are monitored and measured without fragmentation. In PrecursorIonScan mode, fragmentation is on, and fragment ion is selected (per the FragmentMassDetection option), while MS1 masses are scanned across a range (MassDetection). In NeutralIonLoss mode, both MS1 and MS2 masses are scanned, to track specific MS1/MS2 combinations for neutral ion loss. In ProductIonScan, an MS1 mass is selected (MassDetection) and a range of MS2 mass is scanned to survey fragmentation patterns of the parent mass.

For MS1FullScan mode, the collision cell is turned off, and ions are measured and resolved with just the quadrupole time of flight. For MS1FullScanMS2 mode, one intact mass (MassDetection) is selected in the first quadruple and disassociated into fragment ions with the collision cell. Fragment ions are resolved and detected with the quadrupole time of flight. For DataIndependent mode, scans are alternated between scanning a range of MS1FullScan masses (no fragmentation) and scanning fragmentation of a range of masses (MS2). For DataDependent mode, acquisition is split into cycles. For the first scan of each cycle, a survey is taken where the collision cell is off and only intact masses are measured. The top ranking intact ions are noted, then for each consequent scan of the cycle, a ranking intact ion is fragmented, and the resultant fragment ions are resolved and measured on the quadrupole time of flight. A suite of options are available to control how many ions are ranked, which ones are, and to eliminate redundancies. (d):Various mass spectrometry scan modes available for ExperimentLCMS using TripleQuad as the MassAnalyzer. In Full Scan Mode, the entire MS1 range is scanned and fragmentation is off. In SelectedIonMonitoring, select MS1 masses (per the MassDetection option) are monitored and measured without fragmentation. In PrecursorIonScan mode, fragmentation is on, and fragment ion is selected (per the FragmentMassDetection option), while MS1 masses are scanned across a range (MassDetection). In NeutralIonLoss mode, both MS1 and MS2 masses are scanned, to track specific MS1/MS2 combinations for neutral ion loss. In ProductIonScan, an MS1 mass is selected (MassDetection) and a range of MS2 mass is scanned to survey fragmentation patterns of the parent mass. In MultipleReactionMonitoring mode, both MS1 and MS2 are selected - specific intact and fragment ion pairs are monitored.\nDefault Value: Automatic\nDefault Calculation: Set to MS1FullScan unless DataDependent related options are set, then set to DataDependent.\nPattern Description: DataIndependent, DataDependent, MS1FullScan, MS1MS2ProductIonScan, SelectedIonMonitoring, NeutralIonLoss, PrecursorIonScan, or MultipleReactionMonitoring or list of one or more DataIndependent, DataDependent, MS1FullScan, MS1MS2ProductIonScan, SelectedIonMonitoring, NeutralIonLoss, PrecursorIonScan, or MultipleReactionMonitoring entries.\nProgrammatic Pattern: (MSAcquisitionModeP | {MSAcquisitionModeP..}) | Automatic\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\nFragment\nIndicates if ions should be collided with neutral gas and dissociated in order to measure the resulting product ions.

Here, for all of the samples, during the time period from 2 minutes to 5 minutes, an MS1FullScan acquisition is employed (no fragmentation; measure intact ions). From 7 minutes to 9, a data dependent acquisition is performed (see the appropriate section above):\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionWindow -> {\n   \t\tSpan[2 * Minute, 5 * Minute],\n   \t\tSpan[7 * Minute, 9 * Minute]\n   \t},\n \tAcquisitionMode -> {MS1FullScan, DataDependent}\n ]\nSimilarly, different fragmentation instructions can be specified for different time periods:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionWindow -> {\n   \t\tSpan[2 * Minute, 5 * Minute],\n   \t\tSpan[7 * Minute, 9 * Minute]\n   \t},\n \tFragment -> {True, False},\n \tMassDetection -> {650 * Gram / Mole, Protein},\n \tFragmentMassDetection -> {Span[300 * Gram / Mole,\n    1000 * Gram / Mole], Null}\n ]\nMultiple Reaction Monitoring\nSpecified MassAnalyzer, AcquisitionMode, MassSelection and FragmentMassSelection to conduct multiple reaction monitoring analysis by using QTRAP 6500:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionWindow -> {\n   \t\t{\n    \t\t\tSpan[2 * Minute, 5 * Minute],\n    \t\t\tSpan[7 * Minute, 9 * Minute]\n    \t\t}\n   \t},\n \tAcquisitionMode -> {{MS1FullScan, MultipleReactionMonitoring}},\n \tMassAnalyzer -> TripleQuadrupole,\n \tMassDetection -> {\n   \t\t{\n    \t\t\tSpan[Quantity[5, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[1250, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"]\n     \t\t\t]\n    \t\t},\n   \t\t{\n    \t\t\t{\n     \t\t\t\t609.3 * Gram / Mole,\n     \t\t\t\t609.3 * Gram / Mole,\n     \t\t\t\t609.3 * Gram / Mole,\n     \t\t\t\t609.3 * Gram / Mole\n     \t\t\t}\n    \t\t}\n   \t},\n \tFragmentMassDetection -> {\n   \t\t{Null},\n   \t\t{\n    \t\t\t{\n     \t\t\t\t174.1 * Gram / Mole,\n     \t\t\t\t195. * Gram / Mole,\n     \t\t\t\t397.1 * Gram / Mole,\n     \t\t\t\t448.2 * Gram / Mole\n     \t\t\t}\n    \t\t}\n   \t}\n ]\nSpecified MassAnalyzer, AcquisitionMode and MultipleReactionMonitoringAssays to conduct multiple reaction monitoring analysis by using QTRAP 6500:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionMode -> {{MultipleReactionMonitoring}},\n \tMassAnalyzer -> TripleQuadrupole,\n \tMultipleReactionMonitoringAssays -> {\n   \t\t{\n    \t\t\t{\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[356, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[30, \"Volts\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[234, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[4, \"Seconds\"]\n     \t\t\t},\n    \t\t\t{\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[456, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[40, \"Volts\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[345, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[2, \"Seconds\"]\n     \t\t\t},\n    \t\t\t{\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[453, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[65, \"Volts\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[345, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[3, \"Seconds\"]\n     \t\t\t},\n    \t\t\t{\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[764, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[30, \"Volts\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[345, \"Grams\" / \"Moles\"],\n     \t\t\t\tQuantity[2, \"Seconds\"]\n     \t\t\t}\n    \t\t}\n   \t}\n ]\nData Dependent Acquisition\nIn data dependent acquisition, the measurement is split into cycles (see the figure above). In the first part of the cycle, the intact ions (no fragmentations) are surveyed and considered for fragmentation analysis:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,\n \tAcquisitionSurvey -> 20\n ]\nA threshold can be specified on whether to consider an intact ion for fragmentation analysis. Likewise, a limit can be placed so that a highly abundant ion is not overly analyzed:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,\n \tMinimumThreshold -> (100000 * ArbitraryUnit),\n \tAcquisitionLimit -> (2000000 * ArbitraryUnit)\n ]\nVarious m/z can be excluded from the acquisition program:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,\n \tExclusionMass -> {\n   \t\t{All, 656 * Gram / Mole},\n   \t\t{All, 657 * Gram / Mole}\n   \t}\n ]\nMasses can be prioritized for fragmentation as they surface during the surveys:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,\n \tInclusionMass -> {\n   \t\t{Preferential, 987 * Gram / Mole},\n   \t\t{Preferential, 1013 * Gram / Mole}\n   \t}\n ]\nMasses can be prioritized for fragmentation as they surface during the surveys:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,\n \tInclusionMass -> {\n   \t\t{Preferential, 987 * Gram / Mole},\n   \t\t{Preferential, 1013 * Gram / Mole}\n   \t}\n ]\nRedundant isotopes can excluded from acquisition surveys:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples, SurveyIsotopeExclusion -> True]\nRedundant charge states can excluded from acquisition surveys:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples, SurveyChargeStateExclusion -> True]\nStandards and Blanks\nExperimentLCMS can be used to quantify analytes in a sample, in which case, a Standard sample is employed to serve as reference. A standard can be submitted before and after the injection sequence of the samples simply by running:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples, StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast]\nLikewise, a Blank sample can be used to see if there is any background from the injection process. To run a blank to occur between every 5 samples, use the following command:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples, BlankFrequency -> 5]\nPhotoDiodeArray detection\nPhotoDiodeArray detection involves passes light across a range of wavelengths and measures how much light is absorbed for each even wavelength:\nExperimentLCMS[mySamples,\n \tAbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[400, 500 * Nanometer],\n \tUVFilter -> True\n ]\nInjection Table\nIn addition to specifying frequencies of running standards and blanks, now the injection sequence of samples, standards, blanks, and column primes/flushes can be explicitly articulated as well. In this case, an additional column flush is specified after the injection of the second sample:\ncustomInjectionTable = customInjectionTable = {\n    \t{ColumnPrime, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,\n     myMassAcquisitionMethod1},\n    \t{Sample, mySample1, 2 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,\n     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},\n    \t{Blank, myBlank1, 5 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,\n     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},\n    \t{Sample, mySample2, 3 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,\n     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},\n    \t{ColumnFlush, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,\n     myMassAcquisitionMethod1},\n    \t{Standard, myStandard1, 2 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,\n     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},\n    \t{Sample, mySample3, 5 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2,\n     myMassAcquisitionMethod2},\n    \t{ColumnFlush, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1,\n     myMassAcquisitionMethod1}\n    }\nExperimentLCMS[{mySample1, mySample2, mySample3},\n \tInjectionTable -> customInjectionTable\n ]\n\nPreferred Input Containers\nThe autosampler can take 2mL deep well plates.\nThe autosampler can take normal vials routinely used in HPLC analysis.\n\nData Processing\nThe data can be viewed by PlotChromatographyMassSpectra:\nPlotChromatographyMassSpectra[\n \tObject[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, \"Sample LCMS Data\"]\n ]\nThe data can be viewed by different types by spcifying PlotType options:\nPlotChromatographyMassSpectra[\n \tObject[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, \"Sample LCMS Data\"],\n \tPlotType -> AbsorbanceChromatogram\n ]\nUse the PlotType and MassSpectrumTimeRange to plot mass spectrum data with in a certain time range:\nPlotChromatographyMassSpectra[\n \tObject[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, \"Sample LCMS Data\"],\n \tMassSpectrumTimeRange -> {Span[5 * Minute, 5.5 * Minute]},\n \tPlotType -> MassSpectrum\n ]\nUse ExcludeRange to specify one or more ranges of m/z values to exclude from different type of plots:\nPlotChromatographyMassSpectra[\n \tObject[Data, ChromatographyMassSpectra, \"Sample LCMS Data\"],\n \tMassSpectrumTimeRange -> {Span[5 * Minute, 5.5 * Minute]},\n \tPlotType -> WaterfallPlot,\n \tExcludeRange -> {\n   \t\tSpan[0 * Dalton, 300 * Dalton],\n   \t\tSpan[500 * Dalton, 700 * Dalton]\n   \t}\n ]\n\nPossible Issues\nEquilibration\nEquilibrate to the correct buffer conditions at the end of each gradient to reach a state that is appropriate for the start of the next gradient.\nColumn flush\nThe column will end up being stored in whatever the final gradient solvent conditions are so that should be considered for column protection.\nColumn fouling\nConsider using a GuardColumn to preserve column lifetime. Examine injections of standards over time to ensure that the column is performing to satisfaction.\nFilter sample and buffer\nSamples should not have particulates; otherwise, the system will over-pressurize. Consider filtering any samples or buffers used for the LCMS experiment.\n\n[end context 1]\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\n### Comprehensive Protocol for Peptide Synthesis and Validation\n\nThis protocol integrates the best components from previous summaries to ensure a detailed, efficient, and scientifically rigorous approach to peptide synthesis and validation, aligned with the project's goals and constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Peptide Synthesis Protocol\n\n#### Step 1: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentPeptideSynthesis`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Fmoc-protected amino acids: 0.1 M in NMP, stored at 4\u00b0C\n  - Rink amide resin: 1 g, 0.1 mmol/g loading capacity\n  - Coupling reagents: HBTU (0.1 M in DMF), DIPEA (2 M in NMP)\n  - Deprotection agent: 20% piperidine in DMF, freshly prepared\n- **Equipment**: \n  - Automated peptide synthesizer, calibrated for accurate volume delivery\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Resin swelling in DMF for 30 minutes\n  - Coupling: 5 mL amino acid solution, 5 mL HBTU, 2 mL DIPEA, stir for 60 minutes\n  - Deprotection: 10 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 minutes, repeated\n  - Washing: Three washes with 10 mL DMF after each step\n- **Output**: Peptide-resin with confirmed coupling efficiency via HPLC\n\n**Quality Control**:\n- **Coupling Check**: Perform Kaiser test after each coupling step\n- **Documentation**: Record reagent batch numbers, conditions, and deviations\n\n#### Step 2: Cleavage and Deprotection\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentCleavage`\n- **Inputs**:\n  - Cleavage cocktail: TFA:water:triisopropylsilane:ethyl methyl sulfide (95:2.5:1:1.5), 10 mL per gram of resin\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Cleavage at room temperature for 2-3 hours\n- **Output**: Crude peptide in solution\n\n#### Step 3: Purification\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentSolidPhaseExtraction` and `ExperimentHPLC`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Crude peptide solution\n  - Solvent system: 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile-water gradient\n- **Equipment**: \n  - SPE apparatus and HPLC system with C18 column\n- **Conditions**: \n  - SPE: Gradient from 5% to 95% acetonitrile over 30 minutes\n  - HPLC: Flow rate 1 mL/min, UV detection at 214 nm\n- **Output**: Purified peptide >90% purity\n\n#### Step 4: Mass Confirmation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentLCMS`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Purified peptide\n- **Equipment**: \n  - LC-MS system\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Standard LCMS settings for peptide analysis\n- **Output**: Confirmed molecular weight and sequence identity\n\n#### Step 5: Chemical Modifications\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentBioconjugation`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Purified peptide (0.4 mmol)\n  - PEG reagent (0.48 mmol)\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Room temperature, stirring for 2 hours in PBS\n- **Output**: Modified peptide, confirmed by MS\n\n### Peptide Validation Protocol\n\n#### Structural Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentNMR` and `ExperimentCircularDichroism`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - PBS buffer (pH 7.4)\n- **Equipment**: \n  - NMR spectrometer and CD spectrometer\n- **Conditions**: \n  - NMR: Proton and COSY 2D in DMSO-d6\n  - CD: 190-260 nm at 25\u00b0C\n- **Output**: Structural integrity and secondary structure confirmation\n\n#### Binding Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentBioLayerInterferometry` and `ExperimentFluorescencePolarization`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - Target protein: 1 mg/mL in PBS\n- **Equipment**: \n  - BLI instrument and fluorescence polarization reader\n- **Conditions**: \n  - BLI: Measure kinetics at peptide concentrations from 1 nM to 1 \u00b5M\n  - FP: Label peptide with FITC, measure binding across concentrations\n- **Output**: Binding affinity (expected KD <10 nM) and kinetic data\n\n#### Functional Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentELISA`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies\n- **Equipment**: \n  - ELISA plate reader\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Standard ELISA protocol\n- **Output**: Quantitative binding data\n\n#### Stability Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentThermalShift`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - Sypro Orange dye\n- **Equipment**: \n  - Real-time PCR thermal cycler\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Heat and record fluorescence to determine melting temperature\n- **Output**: Thermal stability profile\n\n### Integration with Machine Learning Models\n\n- **Data Handling and Feedback**: Collect binding affinity, structural data, and stability profiles to feed back into machine learning models (ProteinMPNN and RFDiffusion).

        "message": "To implement the `ExperimentLCMS` protocol using Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for the validation of peptide-based therapeutics, we need to carefully select the options that align with our experimental goals. Below is the proposed setup for the `ExperimentLCMS` command, along with explanations for each specified option:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentLCMS[\n  MassAnalyzer -> QTOF,\n  IonMode -> Positive,\n  Calibrant -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, Standard, \"Cesium Iodide ESI Calibrant\"],\n  Gradient -> {\n    {0 * Minute, 95 * Percent, 5 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 1 * Milliliter / Minute},\n    {15 * Minute, 50 * Percent, 50 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 1 * Milliliter / Minute},\n    {30 * Minute, 5 * Percent, 95 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 1 * Milliliter / Minute}\n  },\n  AcquisitionWindow -> {\n    Span[2 * Minute, 5 * Minute],\n    Span[7 * Minute, 9 * Minute]\n  },\n  AcquisitionMode -> {MS1FullScan, DataDependent},\n  Fragment -> {True, False},\n  MassDetection -> {650 * Gram / Mole, Protein},\n  FragmentMassDetection -> {Span[300 * Gram / Mole, 1000 * Gram / Mole], Null}\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **MassAnalyzer -> QTOF**: \n   - **Reason**: The Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (QTOF) mass analyzer is chosen for its high resolution and accuracy, which is essential for analyzing complex peptide mixtures and confirming molecular weights.\n\n2. **IonMode -> Positive**: \n   - **Reason**: Peptides typically ionize better in positive mode due to the presence of basic amino acids, which readily accept protons.\n\n3. **Calibrant -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, Standard, \"Cesium Iodide ESI Calibrant\"]**: \n   - **Reason**: Cesium Iodide is a standard calibrant for ESI in positive mode, providing reliable mass accuracy across the range of interest for peptides.\n\n4. **Gradient**: \n   - **Reason**: A gradient from high aqueous to high organic solvent is typical for peptide separations, allowing for effective elution of peptides based on their hydrophobicity. The specified gradient ensures a broad separation range suitable for complex peptide mixtures.\n\n5. **AcquisitionWindow -> {Span[2 * Minute, 5 * Minute], Span[7 * Minute, 9 * Minute]}**: \n   - **Reason**: These windows are chosen to focus on specific retention times where the peptides of interest are expected to elute, optimizing data collection and reducing unnecessary data acquisition.\n\n6. **AcquisitionMode -> {MS1FullScan, DataDependent}**: \n   - **Reason**: The MS1FullScan mode allows for comprehensive mass detection of intact ions, while DataDependent acquisition targets specific ions for fragmentation, providing detailed structural information.\n\n7. **Fragment -> {True, False}**: \n   - **Reason**: Fragmentation is enabled during the DataDependent acquisition window to obtain MS/MS data for structural confirmation, while it is disabled during the MS1FullScan to focus on intact mass detection.\n\n8. **MassDetection -> {650 * Gram / Mole, Protein}**: \n   - **Reason**: This range is set to capture the expected mass range of the peptides, ensuring that both intact and fragmented ions are detected.\n\n9. **FragmentMassDetection -> {Span[300 * Gram / Mole, 1000 * Gram / Mole], Null}**: \n   - **Reason**: This range is chosen to capture the typical fragment ions generated from peptide fragmentation, aiding in sequence confirmation.\n\nBy setting these options, we ensure that the LC-MS experiment is tailored to effectively validate the synthesized peptides, providing both qualitative and quantitative data necessary for subsequent analyses. This setup aligns with our project goals of high clinical value and impactful scientific application within the constraints of ECL."
