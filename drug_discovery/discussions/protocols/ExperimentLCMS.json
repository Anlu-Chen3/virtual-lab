After separation, analytes are ionized, selected, and detected in the Mass Spectrometer device (see ExperimentMassSpectrometry). Within, ions are resolved by their mass versus charge state. Optionally, ions can be fragmented by collision with an inert gas, and the resulting product ions can, in turn, be resolved and detected for more information. In total, LC-MS can answer composition questions; for example, proteins, lipids, and metabolites can be identified in a sample. Furthermore, LC-MS can answer concentration questions; for instance, nucleotides can be quantified in a biological sample.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a LCMS experiment. Step 1: The system is rinsed with cleaning solutions. Step 2: The stationary column is installed and equilibrated to measurement conditions. Step 3: Samples are then introduced into the flow path. Step 4: The analytes are selectively retained on the downstream column. Step 5: Upon exit from the column, the now separated analytes are analyzed according to their physical property using a mass spectrometer. Step 6: After final sample measurement, the Column(s) are rinsed, removed from the system, and stowed. Step 7: After the column is removed, the system is rinsed with cleaning solution.\n\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\nWaters Acquity UPLC I-Class PDA\n\nModel[Instrument, HPLC, \"id:4pO6dM5lRrl7\"]\n\nFigure 2.1.1: Instrument diagram for the H-Class and I-Class systems. Buffer solutions (up to 4) are steadily pumped through the instrument, consisting of a 6-port valve system, adsorbent column, detectors, and terminates at fraction collection or waste. Samples within the autosampler are loaded into the sample loop via positive displacement from the syringe. The rotation of the valve exposes the sample loop, thereby carrying the sample downstream to the column. Within the column, molecular constituents are separated by adsorption -- a function of the buffers, column, sample properties and temperature. Analytes are continuously carried downstream to the detectors, where they can elicit quantifiable peak signals.\n\nFigure 2.1.2: Principle of PhotodiodeArray detection. Filtered light (across a range of wavelengths) passes through the flow downstream of the column. Presence of light-absorbing molecules will result in less light transmission to the recipient Diode, thereby producing a chromatographic peak for each specific wavelength.\n\nXevo G2-XS QTOF\n\nModel[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, \"id:aXRlGn6KaWdO\"]\n\nFigure 2.2.1: Principles of an electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (QTOF). Analytes are flowed through a capillary tube into a heated source box (SourceTemeprature) at the desired InfusionFlowRate. A confluence of the source box temperature, DesolvationTemperature, DesolvationGasFlow, and ESICapillaryVolage result in neubilization, vaporization, and ionization of the analyte stream to generate an electrospray. The electrospray enters the mass spectrometer through the source cone, which serves to focus the ions and excludes contimation via a ConeGasFlow. Within the mass spectrometer, the electrospray is futher refined via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage) to yeild isolated gas-phase ions. Ions are then focused through a stepwave ion guide path via another applied voltage (StepwaveVoltage) into an ion beam. The ions travel through a quadrupole and a collision cell. Lastly, they enter a time-of-flight analyzer which resolves the ions by their mass to charge ratio according to their travel time. Spectra are continuously acquired for ions inside MassDetection hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration. For time independent samples, an average mass spectrum is generated. When coupled with liquid chromatography (see ExperimentLCMS) time-dependent mass spectra are generated instead.\n\nQTRAP 6500\n\nModel[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, \"id:N80DNj1aROOD\"]\n\nFigure 2.3.1: Principles of an electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-QQQ). Analytes are injected through the capillary tube into the source block at the desired InfusionFlowRate. Once the sample enters the source block, it is evaporated at the DesolvationTemperature under a stream of nitrogen gas with a pressure of DesolvationGasFlow. ESICapillaryVoltage is then applied to the capillary tubing tip to produce an electrospray, which turns into single gas-phase ions due to additional evaporation and desolvation SourceTemperature. Ions, focused by the ConeGasFlow, enter the mass spectrometer through the source cone and follow the ion path via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage). They are then guided through an ion guide path via another applied voltage (IonGuideVoltange) to generate a focused ion beam. Ions travel through the first quadrupole mass analyzer (MS1), where their mass is resolved by their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z, MassDetection). After the MS1, ions enter the collision cell, where they can be fragmented by collision-induced dissociation, resulting in bond breakage and the fragmentation of the molecular ions into smaller fragments. CollisionCellExitVoltage accelerates and guides the fragmented ions to enter the second quadrupole mass analyzer (MS2), where their mass can be resolved again by their m/z (FragmentMassDetection). Spectra are continuously acquired for ions either inside MassDetection as a ranged value or as a fixed value, hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration, and a total mass spectrum is generated.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nGeneral\n\nSeparationMode\n\nThe category of method used to elicit differential column retention due to interaction between molecules in the mobile phase with those on the stationary phase (column).\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to match the Separation Mode listed with the provided column.\n\nPattern Description: NormalPhase, ReversePhase, IonExchange, SizeExclusion, Affinity, or Chiral.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: SeparationModeP | Automatic\n\nMassAnalyzer\n\nThe manner of detection used to resolve and detect molecules.

DataDependent will depend on the properties of the measured mass spectrum of the intact ions. DataIndependent will systemically scan through all of the intact ions. MS1 will focus on defined intact masses. MS1MS2 will focus on fragmented masses.\n\nFigure 3.3: (a),(b) and (c):Various acquisition modes available for ExperimentLCMS using QTOF as the MassAnalyzer. For MS1FullScan mode, the collision cell is turned off, and ions are measured and resolved with just the quadrupole time of flight. For MS1FullScanMS2 mode, one intact mass (MassDetection) is selected in the first quadruple and disassociated into fragment ions with the collision cell. Fragment ions are resolved and detected with the quadrupole time of flight. For DataIndependent mode, scans are alternated between scanning a range of MS1FullScan masses (no fragmentation) and scanning fragmentation of a range of masses (MS2). For DataDependent mode, acquisition is split into cycles. For the first scan of each cycle, a survey is taken where the collision cell is off and only intact masses are measured. The top ranking intact ions are noted, then for each consequent scan of the cycle, a ranking intact ion is fragmented, and the resultant fragment ions are resolved and measured on the quadrupole time of flight. A suite of options are available to control how many ions are ranked, which ones are, and to eliminate redundancies. (d):Various mass spectrometry scan modes available for ExperimentLCMS using TripleQuad as the MassAnalyzer. In Full Scan Mode, the entire MS1 range is scanned and fragmentation is off. In SelectedIonMonitoring, select MS1 masses (per the MassDetection option) are monitored and measured without fragmentation. In PrecursorIonScan mode, fragmentation is on, and fragment ion is selected (per the FragmentMassDetection option), while MS1 masses are scanned across a range (MassDetection). In NeutralIonLoss mode, both MS1 and MS2 masses are scanned, to track specific MS1/MS2 combinations for neutral ion loss.

For MS1FullScan mode, the collision cell is turned off, and ions are measured and resolved with just the quadrupole time of flight. For MS1FullScanMS2 mode, one intact mass (MassDetection) is selected in the first quadruple and disassociated into fragment ions with the collision cell. Fragment ions are resolved and detected with the quadrupole time of flight. For DataIndependent mode, scans are alternated between scanning a range of MS1FullScan masses (no fragmentation) and scanning fragmentation of a range of masses (MS2). For DataDependent mode, acquisition is split into cycles. For the first scan of each cycle, a survey is taken where the collision cell is off and only intact masses are measured. The top ranking intact ions are noted, then for each consequent scan of the cycle, a ranking intact ion is fragmented, and the resultant fragment ions are resolved and measured on the quadrupole time of flight. A suite of options are available to control how many ions are ranked, which ones are, and to eliminate redundancies. (d):Various mass spectrometry scan modes available for ExperimentLCMS using TripleQuad as the MassAnalyzer. In Full Scan Mode, the entire MS1 range is scanned and fragmentation is off. In SelectedIonMonitoring, select MS1 masses (per the MassDetection option) are monitored and measured without fragmentation. In PrecursorIonScan mode, fragmentation is on, and fragment ion is selected (per the FragmentMassDetection option), while MS1 masses are scanned across a range (MassDetection). In NeutralIonLoss mode, both MS1 and MS2 masses are scanned, to track specific MS1/MS2 combinations for neutral ion loss. In ProductIonScan, an MS1 mass is selected (MassDetection) and a range of MS2 mass is scanned to survey fragmentation patterns of the parent mass.

Here is a proposed setup for the `ExperimentLCMS` call, along with explanations for each specified option:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentLCMS[\n  myPeptideSample,\n  MassAnalyzer -> QTOF,\n  IonMode -> Positive,\n  Calibrant -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, Standard, \"Cesium Iodide ESI Calibrant\"],\n  AcquisitionWindow -> {Span[0 * Minute, 30 * Minute]},\n  AcquisitionMode -> MS1FullScan,\n  Gradient -> {\n    {0 * Minute, 95 * Percent, 5 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0.3 * Milliliter / Minute},\n    {15 * Minute, 50 * Percent, 50 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0.3 * Milliliter / Minute},\n    {30 * Minute, 5 * Percent, 95 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 0.3 * Milliliter / Minute}\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **MassAnalyzer -> QTOF**: \n   - **Reason**: The QTOF (Quadrupole Time-of-Flight) mass analyzer is chosen for its high resolution and accuracy, which is essential for confirming the molecular weight and sequence identity of peptides. This aligns with our goal of ensuring high clinical value through precise validation.\n\n2. **IonMode -> Positive**: \n   - **Reason**: Peptides typically ionize better in positive ion mode due to the presence of basic amino acid residues. This setting enhances sensitivity and detection efficiency.\n\n3. **Calibrant -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, Standard, \"Cesium Iodide ESI Calibrant\"]**: \n   - **Reason**: Cesium iodide is a standard calibrant for ESI (Electrospray Ionization) in positive mode, providing reliable mass accuracy across a wide range of m/z values, which is crucial for peptide analysis.\n\n4. **AcquisitionWindow -> {Span[0 * Minute, 30 * Minute]}**: \n   - **Reason**: This window covers the entire gradient run, ensuring that all peptide elution events are captured for analysis.\n\n5. **AcquisitionMode -> MS1FullScan**: \n   - **Reason**: MS1FullScan is used to detect intact ions without fragmentation, which is suitable for confirming the presence and purity of the synthesized peptides.\n\n6. **Gradient**: \n   - **Reason**: The gradient is designed to separate peptides effectively over a 30-minute run. Starting with a high percentage of aqueous buffer (Buffer A) and gradually increasing the organic solvent (Buffer B) helps in resolving peptides based on their hydrophobicity. The flow rate of 0.3 mL/min is chosen to balance resolution and analysis time.\n\n### Default Options:\n\nMost other options are left at their default values to streamline the experiment setup and focus on the critical parameters that impact peptide analysis. This approach ensures that the experiment is both efficient and aligned with the project's goals of high clinical value and impactful scientific application.\n\nBy implementing this protocol in ECL, we ensure that the experimental validation is conducted within the 3-month limit, leveraging the platform's capabilities for precise and reproducible results. This setup will provide the necessary data to feed back into our machine learning models, enhancing their predictive power for future peptide design iterations."
