In UV-Vis experiment (e.g., ExperimentAbsorbanceSpectroscopy, ExperimentUVMelting etc), samples are exposed to the unpolarized light, where its electric and magnetic fields perpendicular oscillate in all directions perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light. In circularly polarized light, the electric field vector rotates around the propagation direction at a constant magnitude, resulting in the electric field vector appearing to trace a circle throughout one wave frequency. Optically active chiral molecules will preferentially absorb one direction of the circularly polarized light. The difference in absorption of the left and right circularly polarized light can be measured and quantified as absorption bands. CD spectroscopy can probe the secondary structure composition of polypeptides/proteins and determine the tertiary structure class of globular proteins.\n\nExperimental Principles\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a CircularDichroism experiment using an Ekko CD plate reader.Step 1:Samples and blanks are loaded to the plate for reading.Step 2 (optional):the sample volume will be measured by the supersonic method to calculate the pathlength.Step 3:Samples are loaded to the instrument.Step 4:The circular dichroism of samples is measured as ellipticity,based on differential absorption of the left and right circularly polarized light of samples.Step 5:Data is plotted and visualized.\n\nInstrumentation\nEkko\nModel[Instrument, PlateReader, \"id:mnk9jORmGjEw\"]\nFigure 2.1.1: In an Ekko CD Microplate Reader, a Xenon Lamp emits the full-spectrum light. The light is then split and diffracted into several beams by passing a grating monochromator to emit non-polarized light. The non-polarized light then passes the polarizer to generate linear polarized light. The linear polarized light then passes through the photoelastic modulator to create both left- and right-hand circular polarized light. Finally, the differential absorbed circularly polarized light. The transmitted light is then directed through a prism that splits the beam into wavelengths from 185 nm to 900 nm as measured by the detector.\n\nExperiment Options\nGeneral\nInstrument\nThe plate reader that is used for measuring circular dichroism spectroscopy or circular dichroism intensity at specific wavelengths.\nDefault Value: Model[Instrument, PlateReader, Ekko]\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Instrument, PlateReader] or Object[Instrument, PlateReader]\nProgrammatic Pattern: ObjectP[{Model[Instrument, PlateReader], Object[Instrument, PlateReader]}]\nPreparedPlate\nIndicates if the plate containing the samples for the CircularDichroism experiment has been previously prepared that does not need to run sample preparation steps.\nDefault Value: False\nPattern Description: True or False.\nProgrammatic Pattern: BooleanP\nOptics\nRetainCover\nIndicates if the plate seal or lid on the assay container is left on during measurement to decrease evaporation.

If EnantiomericExcessWavelength is blank, this option resolves based on Analytes option: if Analytes are specified as biomacromolecules (Proteins, Peptides, Oligomers), resolves this option to Span[200 Nanometer, 400 Nanometer]; Else resolved to Span[300 Nanometer, 800 Nanometer].\nPattern Description: Multiple or Range or Single.\nProgrammatic Pattern: (RangeP[185*Nanometer, 850*Nanometer] | RangeP[185*Nanometer, 850*Nanometer] ;; RangeP[185*Nanometer, 850*Nanometer] | {RangeP[185*Nanometer, 850*Nanometer]..}) | Automatic\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\nStepSize\nThis option determines how often the spectrophotometer will record an circular dichroism absorbance measurement, if the sample was scanned in a range of wavelength. For example, a step size of 2 nanometer indicates that the spectrophotometer will collect circular dichroism absorbance data for every 2 nanometer within the wavelength range.\nDefault Value: Automatic\nDefault Calculation: Automatically resolves to 1 Nanomer if the DetectionWavelength is resolved as a range values.

        "message": "To implement the `ExperimentCircularDichroism` protocol using Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for the validation of peptide-based therapeutics, we need to carefully select the options that align with our experimental design and objectives. Here's how we can set up the experiment:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentCircularDichroism[\n    mySamples,\n    DetectionWavelength -> Span[190 * Nanometer, 260 * Nanometer],\n    CalculatingMolarEllipticitySpectrum -> True,\n    Analyte -> {\n        Model[Molecule, \"id:dORYzZJNK955\"],\n        Model[Molecule, \"id:J8AY5jDB0nlE\"],\n        Model[Molecule, \"id:J8AY5jDB0nlE\"]\n    },\n    AnalyteConcentration -> {1.1 * Micromolar, 1.2 * Micromolar, 1.3 * Micromolar},\n    BlankAbsorbance -> True,\n    Blanks -> Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"],\n    BlankVolumes -> (250 * Microliter),\n    NumberOfReplicates -> 3,\n    MoatSize -> 2,\n    MoatBuffer -> Null,\n    MoatVolume -> Automatic,\n    NitrogenPurge -> True,\n    ReadDirection -> Row,\n    AverageTime -> 1 * Second\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Selected Options:\n\n1. **DetectionWavelength -> Span[190 * Nanometer, 260 * Nanometer]**: This range is chosen to cover the far-UV region, which is critical for assessing the secondary structure of peptides. This range is typical for analyzing peptide and protein secondary structures.\n\n2. **CalculatingMolarEllipticitySpectrum -> True**: This option is selected to convert the ellipticity data into molar ellipticity, which is essential for comparing the structural features of different peptides quantitatively.\n\n3. **Analyte and AnalyteConcentration**: These options specify the peptides being analyzed and their concentrations. The IDs correspond to the specific peptides synthesized, and the concentrations are set based on the experimental design to ensure accurate molar ellipticity calculations.\n\n4. **BlankAbsorbance -> True** and **Blanks -> Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"]**: These options ensure that background signals are accounted for, improving the accuracy of the CD measurements.\n\n5. **BlankVolumes -> (250 * Microliter)**: This volume is chosen to match the sample volume, ensuring consistent conditions across all wells.\n\n6. **NumberOfReplicates -> 3**: Performing triplicate measurements increases the reliability and statistical significance of the data.\n\n7. **MoatSize -> 2** and **MoatBuffer -> Null**: These settings help minimize edge effects and evaporation, which can affect the accuracy of CD measurements.\n\n8. **NitrogenPurge -> True**: This option is selected to prevent ozone formation, which can interfere with measurements, especially in the far-UV region.\n\n9. **ReadDirection -> Row**: This setting optimizes the reading path for efficiency and consistency.\n\n10. **AverageTime -> 1 * Second**: A 1-second averaging time balances data quality and throughput, providing smooth spectra without excessive noise.\n\nBy configuring these options, we ensure that the experiment is tailored to our specific needs, focusing on obtaining high-quality data for the structural validation of peptide-based therapeutics. This setup aligns with our project's goals of high clinical value and impactful scientific application, while also adhering to the constraints of using ECL for experimental validation."
