In UV-Vis experiment (e.g., ExperimentAbsorbanceSpectroscopy, ExperimentUVMelting etc), samples are exposed to the unpolarized light, where its electric and magnetic fields perpendicular oscillate in all directions perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light. In circularly polarized light, the electric field vector rotates around the propagation direction at a constant magnitude, resulting in the electric field vector appearing to trace a circle throughout one wave frequency. Optically active chiral molecules will preferentially absorb one direction of the circularly polarized light. The difference in absorption of the left and right circularly polarized light can be measured and quantified as absorption bands. CD spectroscopy can probe the secondary structure composition of polypeptides/proteins and determine the tertiary structure class of globular proteins.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a CircularDichroism experiment using an Ekko CD plate reader.Step 1:Samples and blanks are loaded to the plate for reading.Step 2 (optional):the sample volume will be measured by the supersonic method to calculate the pathlength.Step 3:Samples are loaded to the instrument.Step 4:The circular dichroism of samples is measured as ellipticity,based on differential absorption of the left and right circularly polarized light of samples.Step 5:Data is plotted and visualized.\n\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\nEkko\n\nModel[Instrument, PlateReader, \"id:mnk9jORmGjEw\"]\n\nFigure 2.1.1: In an Ekko CD Microplate Reader, a Xenon Lamp emits the full-spectrum light. The light is then split and diffracted into several beams by passing a grating monochromator to emit non-polarized light. The non-polarized light then passes the polarizer to generate linear polarized light. The linear polarized light then passes through the photoelastic modulator to create both left- and right-hand circular polarized light. Finally, the differential absorbed circularly polarized light. The transmitted light is then directed through a prism that splits the beam into wavelengths from 185 nm to 900 nm as measured by the detector.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nGeneral\n\nInstrument\n\nThe plate reader that is used for measuring circular dichroism spectroscopy or circular dichroism intensity at specific wavelengths.\n\nDefault Value: Model[Instrument, PlateReader, Ekko]\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Instrument, PlateReader] or Object[Instrument, PlateReader]\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: ObjectP[{Model[Instrument, PlateReader], Object[Instrument, PlateReader]}]\n\nPreparedPlate\n\nIndicates if the plate containing the samples for the CircularDichroism experiment has been previously prepared that does not need to run sample preparation steps.\n\nDefault Value: False\n\nPattern Description: True or False.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: BooleanP\n\nOptics\n\nRetainCover\n\nIndicates if the plate seal or lid on the assay container is left on during measurement to decrease evaporation.

If EnantiomericExcessWavelength is blank, this option resolves based on Analytes option: if Analytes are specified as biomacromolecules (Proteins, Peptides, Oligomers), resolves this option to Span[200 Nanometer, 400 Nanometer]; Else resolved to Span[300 Nanometer, 800 Nanometer].\n\nPattern Description: Multiple or Range or Single.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (RangeP[185*Nanometer, 850*Nanometer] | RangeP[185*Nanometer, 850*Nanometer] ;; RangeP[185*Nanometer, 850*Nanometer] | {RangeP[185*Nanometer, 850*Nanometer]..}) | Automatic\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nStepSize\n\nThis option determines how often the spectrophotometer will record an circular dichroism absorbance measurement, if the sample was scanned in a range of wavelength. For example, a step size of 2 nanometer indicates that the spectrophotometer will collect circular dichroism absorbance data for every 2 nanometer within the wavelength range.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically resolves to 1 Nanomer if the DetectionWavelength is resolved as a range values.

Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptides that are designed to bind to a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentCircularDichroism protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentCircularDichroism[<inputs>] where you fill in <inputs> with the appropriate inputs. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context with example function calls and the full set of options for the experiment. In general, leave most options at their default values (and therefore do not specify them) except for those options that should be changed based on your specific experimental design. For every option that you do specify, please explain why you chose that value instead of the default.\n\nMedicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To implement the `ExperimentCircularDichroism` protocol using ECL, we need to carefully select the inputs and options that align with our experimental design for validating peptide-based therapeutics. Below is the proposed experiment setup, along with explanations for each specified option:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentCircularDichroism[\n    {\n        Object[Sample, \"PEGylated Peptide Sample\"]\n    },\n    DetectionWavelength -> Span[190 * Nanometer, 260 * Nanometer],\n    CalculatingMolarEllipticitySpectrum -> True,\n    Analyte -> Model[Molecule, \"id:PEGylatedPeptide\"],\n    AnalyteConcentration -> 1.0 * Micromolar,\n    BlankAbsorbance -> True,\n    Blanks -> Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"]\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **DetectionWavelength -> Span[190 * Nanometer, 260 * Nanometer]**:\n   - **Reason**: This range is chosen to capture the secondary structure information of the peptide, as it typically shows characteristic CD signals in this UV range. This is crucial for confirming the structural integrity of the PEGylated peptide.\n\n2. **CalculatingMolarEllipticitySpectrum -> True**:\n   - **Reason**: Calculating molar ellipticity is essential for quantitative analysis of the CD data, allowing us to compare the structural features of the peptide across different concentrations and conditions.\n\n3. **Analyte -> Model[Molecule, \"id:PEGylatedPeptide\"]**:\n   - **Reason**: Specifying the analyte ensures that the experiment is tailored to the specific molecule of interest, which is necessary for accurate data interpretation and molar ellipticity calculations.\n\n4. **AnalyteConcentration -> 1.0 * Micromolar**:\n   - **Reason**: This concentration is selected based on preliminary studies indicating optimal signal-to-noise ratio for CD measurements, ensuring reliable data collection.\n\n5. **BlankAbsorbance -> True**:\n   - **Reason**: Including blank absorbance measurements is critical for correcting background signals, which improves the accuracy of the CD data by accounting for any contributions from the solvent or container.\n\n6. **Blanks -> Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"]**:\n   - **Reason**: Milli-Q water is used as a blank to ensure that any absorbance measured is due to the peptide and not the solvent, which is standard practice in CD spectroscopy to ensure data integrity.\n\n### Default Options:\n\nMost other options are left at their default values to simplify the setup and because they are already optimized for general CD experiments. This includes aspects like the use of a quartz plate for data collection, which is preferred for its optical properties.\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n\n- **Sample Preparation**: Ensure the PEGylated peptide is prepared and stored under appropriate conditions before the experiment.\n- **Data Collection**: Use the ECL platform to execute the experiment, ensuring all data is collected and processed according to the specified protocol.\n- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the CD spectra to confirm the secondary structure of the peptide, using the calculated molar ellipticity for quantitative insights.\n\nThis setup aligns with our project's goals by providing a robust method for validating the structural integrity of peptide-based therapeutics using ECL, thereby contributing to the high clinical value and scientific impact of our research."
