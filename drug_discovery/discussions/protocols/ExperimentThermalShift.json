This assay utilizes either extrinsic fluorescent dyes or intrinsic fluorescence to monitor conformational changes in nucleic acids or proteins. Additionally, sample aggregate formation across a temperature gradient can be measured using static light scattering whereby larger molecules scatter more light. The data generated by this experiment can be used to determine the samples\u2019 melting point or aggregation point which is characteristic of the samples\u2019 sequence, length, concentration, and solvent conditions. Resulting shifts in melting and aggregation points compared to a reference are indicative of sample thermal stability under varying conditions.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Step1: Samples can be diluted, pooled, mixed, incubated, and/or annealed in preparation for thermal shift analysis. Sample dilution occurs prior to sample pooling. When all samples in a pool are diluted, the total number of dilutions of each sample in the pool must match. When one sample in a pool is diluted and its partner is not diluted, the undiluted pooling partner will be pooled with each dilution of its partner at the desired AliquotAmount. Step2: Prepared samples are transferred into instrument compatible containers. For the Uncle multimode spectrophotometer, samples are loaded into a 16 well quartz capillary strip. For the ViiA 7 Real-Time thermocycler, samples are loaded into a 384-well v-bottom optical assay plate. Step3: Prepared samples are loaded into the instrument and equilibrated to the starting temperature of the following thermal ramp. A total of three capillary strips can be loaded into the Uncle at once. Step4: Sample fluorescence (and static light scattering if desired) measurement during thermal ramp. For the Uncle, fluorescence and static light scattering are measured for each capillary independently. For the ViiA 7, fluorescence measurements are collected at each excitation wavelength simultaneously for all wells. Steps 3 & 4 are repeated for each heating and cooling cycle. Step5: Data is assessed using AnalyzeMeltingPoint to determine the melting temperature of samples. Static light scattering data from the Uncle can also be analyzed to determine relative changes in aggregation temperature of samples.\n\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\nUncle\n\nModel[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer, \"id:4pO6dM508MbX\"]\n\nFigure 2.1.1: The Uncle is a multimode spectrophotometer with the capacity to interrogate forty eight samples in one run. Samples must be assayed in Uncle compatible capillary strips. Each strip contains 16 quartz capillaries and each capillary requires 9 uL of sample. Sample fluorescence and static light scattering intensity are excited by 266 nm and 473 nm long-life lasers and detected by a full-spectrum spectrometer consisting of a CCD camera pixel array. Excitation laser power can be specified from opaque to full power (0 - 100% respectively). Sample dynamic light scattering can be quantified by a 660 nm laser diode and detected using an avalanche photodiode module. For all measurements, each capillary is interrogated independently. Thermal profiles can be programmed into the instrument to interrogate samples at multiple temperatures. Capillary strip temperature is controlled by a thermoelectric heating and cooling plate and can range from 15\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C.\n\nViiA 7\n\nModel[Instrument, Thermocycler, \"id:D8KAEvdqzXYk\"]\n\nFigure 2.2.1: The ViiA 7 offers real-time monitoring of target sequence amplification during 384-well plate-based PCR procedures. The thermocycling profile is programmable in the temperature range from 4 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C, with a maximum ramp rate of 3.4 \u00b0C/sec. The ViiA 7's excitation wavelengths of 470, 520, 550, 580, 640, and 662 nm and emission wavelengths of 520, 558, 586, 623, 682, and 711 nm allow monitoring of the amplification targets via a variety of dyes or reporters.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nGeneral\n\nInstrument\n\nThe instrument used to perform the thermal shift experiment.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to Model[Instrument, Thermocycler, \"ViiA 7\"] or Model[Instrument, Thermocycler, \"QuantStudio 7 Flex\"] for nucleic acid samples and Model[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer, \"Uncle\"] for protein samples\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Instrument, Thermocycler], Object[Instrument, Thermocycler], Model[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer], or Object[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer]\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: ObjectP[{Model[Instrument, Thermocycler], Object[Instrument, Thermocycler], Model[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer], Object[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer]}] | Automatic\n\nNumberOfReplicates\n\nThe number of different analysis wells in which each nested index matching sample is measured.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to 2 if Instrument is set to a Model[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer] or Object[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer].\n\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 2 in increments of 1 or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (GreaterEqualP[2, 1] | Automatic) | Null\n\nAnalyteType\n\nThe type of molecule present in the nested index matching sample that is detected during instrument measurement.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to the type of specified analytes in the sample definition.\n\nPattern Description: Oligomer or Protein.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (Oligomer | Protein) | Automatic\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nDynamicLightScatteringCapillaryLoading\n\nThe loading method for capillaries when the instrument used is Model[Instrument, MultimodeSpectrophotometer, \"Uncle\"] .

Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptide-based therapeutics for a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentThermalShift protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentThermalShift[<options>] where you fill in <options> with the appropriate options. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context. In general, leave most options at their default values (and therefore do not specify them) except for those options that should be changed based on your specific experimental design. For every option that you do specify, please explain why you chose that value.\n\nMedicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda."
