The principle of FP is that a fluorophore excited by polarized light emits light oriented in a parallel plane. After a fluorescent molecule absorbs excitation light, it tumbles and rotates in solution during the time between excitation and emission. If the molecule is large, it rotates slowly, and the emission light remains largely polarized. Whereas a small, rapidly tumbling molecule rotates quickly and emits depolarized light. Measuring the degree of polarization provides a measure of the fraction of tracer bound to receptor, with applications in receptor-ligand binding, enzymatic degradation, and DNA hybridization studies.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a Fluorescence Polarization experiment. Step 1: Samples are prepared in a reader-compatible shallow well plate. Step 2: Injection lines are cleaned and primed. Step 3: The assay plate is optionally held at a specified temperature. Step 4: Injection samples are dispensed into the assay plate. Step 5: The assay plate is shaken. Step 6: The plate reader excites samples with horizontally polarized light and measures emitted light in the horizontal and vertical planes. Large molecules rotate slower than small molecules and reflect more polarized light. Step 7: Optionally follow-up analysis, such as standard curve fitting, can be performed.\n\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\nPHERAstar FS\n\nModel[Instrument, PlateReader, \"id:01G6nvkKr3o7\"]\n\nFigure 2.1.1: The PHERAstar uses optic modules to package excitation and emission filters into a single package. This means wavelength combinations are restricted to those which already exist in the optic module. Up to five excitation/emission pairs can be recorded in a single experiment. Additionally, the PHERAstar supports dual emission so it's possible to record emission data at 2 different wavelengths simultaneously. The plate chamber can be heated up to 45\u00b0C and it can mix the plate at up to 700 RPM before and/or during the run. The reader has two 300\u03bcL syringe pump injectors which can be used for 0.5 - 300 \u03bcL injections of two unique samples at up to four time points during the run. There are two primary kinetics read modes. It can perform all readings, injections and mixing for a single well before moving onto the next well or it can read in cycles, reading all the assay wells in the plate again and again until the RunTime has been reached. The second mode is recommended for most assays, except those that use very fast kinetics.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nOptics\n\nExcitationWavelength\n\nThe wavelength(s) which should be used to excite fluorescence in the samples.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 320 nanometers and less than or equal to 740 nanometers.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: RangeP[320*Nanometer, 740*Nanometer] | Automatic\n\nIndex Matches to: ExcitationWavelength\n\nEmissionWavelength\n\nThe wavelength(s) at which fluorescence emitted from the sample should be measured.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 320 nanometers and less than or equal to 740 nanometers.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: RangeP[320*Nanometer, 740*Nanometer] | Automatic\n\nIndex Matches to: ExcitationWavelength\n\nDualEmissionWavelength\n\nThe wavelength at which fluorescence emitted from the sample should be measured with the secondary detector (simultaneous to the measurement at the emission wavelength done by the primary detector).\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 320 nanometers and less than or equal to 740 nanometers or Null.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (RangeP[320*Nanometer, 740*Nanometer] | Automatic) | Null\n\nIndex Matches to: ExcitationWavelength\n\nInstrument\n\nThe plate reader used to measure fluorescence intensity.\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Instrument, PlateReader] or Object[Instrument, PlateReader]\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: ObjectP[{Model[Instrument, PlateReader], Object[Instrument, PlateReader]}] | Automatic\n\nGeneral\n\nGain\n\nThe gain which should be applied to the signal reaching the primary detector.

Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptides that are designed to bind to a given protein drug target.

Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context with example function calls and the full set of options for the experiment.

        "message": "To implement the `ExperimentFluorescencePolarization` protocol using ECL, we need to carefully select the inputs and options that align with our experimental design and objectives. Below is a proposed setup for the experiment, along with explanations for each specified option:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentFluorescencePolarization[\n    mySamples,\n    ExcitationWavelength -> (485 * Nanometer),\n    EmissionWavelength -> (520 * Nanometer),\n    PlateReaderMix -> True,\n    PlateReaderMixTime -> (1 * Minute),\n    PlateReaderMixRate -> (700 * RPM),\n    PrimaryGain -> (50 * Percent),\n    NumberOfReplicates -> 3\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **ExcitationWavelength -> (485 * Nanometer)** and **EmissionWavelength -> (520 * Nanometer)**:\n   - **Reason**: These wavelengths are commonly used for fluorescein-based tracers, which are often employed in fluorescence polarization assays. This choice ensures optimal excitation and emission for our labeled peptide, enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of the binding measurements.\n\n2. **PlateReaderMix -> True**, **PlateReaderMixTime -> (1 * Minute)**, and **PlateReaderMixRate -> (700 * RPM)**:\n   - **Reason**: Mixing the samples ensures homogeneity and improves the interaction between the peptide and the target protein. The specified mixing time and rate are chosen to maximize mixing efficiency without causing excessive evaporation or sample loss.\n\n3. **PrimaryGain -> (50 * Percent)**:\n   - **Reason**: Setting the gain to 50% of the instrument's dynamic range allows for a balanced signal that is neither too weak nor saturated, facilitating accurate measurement across a range of sample concentrations.\n\n4. **NumberOfReplicates -> 3**:\n   - **Reason**: Performing the experiment in triplicate increases the reliability of the data by allowing for statistical analysis and reducing the impact of any outliers or experimental errors.\n\n### Default Options:\n\nMost other options are left at their default values to simplify the setup and because they are adequate for our experimental needs. For instance, the default temperature (ambient) and read location (top) are suitable for our assay conditions.\n\n### Implementation Considerations:\n\n- **Sample Preparation**: Ensure that the peptide samples are properly labeled with a fluorophore compatible with the selected wavelengths.\n- **Data Analysis**: Plan for subsequent data analysis to determine binding affinities and kinetics, which will be fed back into the machine learning models for further refinement.\n\nThis setup aligns with our project goals by providing a robust method for validating peptide-protein interactions, which is crucial for the development of peptide-based therapeutics. The use of ECL ensures that the experiments are conducted under controlled and reproducible conditions, facilitating high-quality data collection within the 3-month experimental timeline."
