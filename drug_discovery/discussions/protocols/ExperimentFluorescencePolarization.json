The principle of FP is that a fluorophore excited by polarized light emits light oriented in a parallel plane. After a fluorescent molecule absorbs excitation light, it tumbles and rotates in solution during the time between excitation and emission. If the molecule is large, it rotates slowly, and the emission light remains largely polarized. Whereas a small, rapidly tumbling molecule rotates quickly and emits depolarized light. Measuring the degree of polarization provides a measure of the fraction of tracer bound to receptor, with applications in receptor-ligand binding, enzymatic degradation, and DNA hybridization studies.\n\nExperimental Principles\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a Fluorescence Polarization experiment. Step 1: Samples are prepared in a reader-compatible shallow well plate. Step 2: Injection lines are cleaned and primed. Step 3: The assay plate is optionally held at a specified temperature. Step 4: Injection samples are dispensed into the assay plate. Step 5: The assay plate is shaken. Step 6: The plate reader excites samples with horizontally polarized light and measures emitted light in the horizontal and vertical planes. Large molecules rotate slower than small molecules and reflect more polarized light. Step 7: Optionally follow-up analysis, such as standard curve fitting, can be performed.\n\nInstrumentation\nPHERAstar FS\nModel[Instrument, PlateReader, \"id:01G6nvkKr3o7\"]\nFigure 2.1.1: The PHERAstar uses optic modules to package excitation and emission filters into a single package. This means wavelength combinations are restricted to those which already exist in the optic module. Up to five excitation/emission pairs can be recorded in a single experiment. Additionally, the PHERAstar supports dual emission so it's possible to record emission data at 2 different wavelengths simultaneously. The plate chamber can be heated up to 45\u00b0C and it can mix the plate at up to 700 RPM before and/or during the run. The reader has two 300\u03bcL syringe pump injectors which can be used for 0.5 - 300 \u03bcL injections of two unique samples at up to four time points during the run. There are two primary kinetics read modes. It can perform all readings, injections and mixing for a single well before moving onto the next well or it can read in cycles, reading all the assay wells in the plate again and again until the RunTime has been reached. The second mode is recommended for most assays, except those that use very fast kinetics.\n\nExperiment Options\nOptics\nExcitationWavelength\nThe wavelength(s) which should be used to excite fluorescence in the samples.\nDefault Value: Automatic\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 320 nanometers and less than or equal to 740 nanometers.\nProgrammatic Pattern: RangeP[320*Nanometer, 740*Nanometer] | Automatic\nIndex Matches to: ExcitationWavelength\nEmissionWavelength\nThe wavelength(s) at which fluorescence emitted from the sample should be measured.\nDefault Value: Automatic\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 320 nanometers and less than or equal to 740 nanometers.\nProgrammatic Pattern: RangeP[320*Nanometer, 740*Nanometer] | Automatic\nIndex Matches to: ExcitationWavelength\nDualEmissionWavelength\nThe wavelength at which fluorescence emitted from the sample should be measured with the secondary detector (simultaneous to the measurement at the emission wavelength done by the primary detector).\nDefault Value: Automatic\nPattern Description: Greater than or equal to 320 nanometers and less than or equal to 740 nanometers or Null.\nProgrammatic Pattern: (RangeP[320*Nanometer, 740*Nanometer] | Automatic) | Null\nIndex Matches to: ExcitationWavelength\nInstrument\nThe plate reader used to measure fluorescence intensity.\nDefault Value: Automatic\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Instrument, PlateReader] or Object[Instrument, PlateReader]\nProgrammatic Pattern: ObjectP[{Model[Instrument, PlateReader], Object[Instrument, PlateReader]}] | Automatic\nGeneral\nGain\nThe gain which should be applied to the signal reaching the primary detector.

Below is the proposed setup for the experiment, along with explanations for each specified option:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentFluorescencePolarization[\n  ExcitationWavelength -> (485 * Nanometer),\n  EmissionWavelength -> (520 * Nanometer),\n  PlateReaderMix -> True,\n  PlateReaderMixTime -> (1 * Minute),\n  PlateReaderMixRate -> (700 * RPM),\n  PrimaryGain -> (50 * Percent),\n  NumberOfReplicates -> 3,\n  Temperature -> 37 * Celsius,\n  EquilibrationTime -> (5 * Minute)\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **ExcitationWavelength -> (485 * Nanometer)**:\n   - **Reason**: This wavelength is commonly used for fluorescein-based dyes, such as FITC, which are often used in fluorescence polarization assays. It ensures optimal excitation of the labeled peptide.\n\n2. **EmissionWavelength -> (520 * Nanometer)**:\n   - **Reason**: This is the typical emission wavelength for fluorescein-based dyes. It matches the emission peak, allowing for accurate measurement of fluorescence.\n\n3. **PlateReaderMix -> True**:\n   - **Reason**: Ensures thorough mixing of samples, which is critical for achieving uniform binding conditions and accurate polarization measurements.\n\n4. **PlateReaderMixTime -> (1 * Minute)**:\n   - **Reason**: A 1-minute mixing time is sufficient to ensure homogeneity in the well without causing excessive sample evaporation or degradation.\n\n5. **PlateReaderMixRate -> (700 * RPM)**:\n   - **Reason**: The maximum mixing rate ensures efficient mixing, which is particularly important for viscous or complex samples.\n\n6. **PrimaryGain -> (50 * Percent)**:\n   - **Reason**: Setting the gain to 50% of the instrument's dynamic range allows for a balanced signal that avoids saturation while maintaining sensitivity.\n\n7. **NumberOfReplicates -> 3**:\n   - **Reason**: Performing the experiment in triplicate provides statistical reliability and helps identify any anomalies or inconsistencies in the data.\n\n8. **Temperature -> 37 * Celsius**:\n   - **Reason**: Conducting the experiment at physiological temperature is crucial for mimicking in vivo conditions, which can affect binding interactions.\n\n9. **EquilibrationTime -> (5 * Minute)**:\n   - **Reason**: Allowing the samples to equilibrate at the assay temperature ensures that all components reach a stable state before measurement, improving data consistency.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Default Options**: Most other options are left at their default values to simplify the setup and because they are adequate for this type of assay.\n- **Experimental Context**: This setup is designed to validate the binding of a PEGylated peptide to a target protein, using fluorescence polarization as a readout for binding affinity and kinetics.\n\nThis protocol aligns with our project goals by ensuring high clinical relevance through physiological conditions and robust data collection, while also leveraging ECL's capabilities for precise and automated experimental execution."
