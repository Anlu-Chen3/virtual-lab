ExperimentCircularDichroism[Samples]âŸ¹Protocol

generates a Protocol object for measuring the differential absorption of left and right circularly polarized light of the Samples.



Circular Dichroism (CD, aka Electronic Circular Dichroism (ECD)) measures how samples differentially absorb left and right circularly polarized light radiation, either at a specific wavelength or over a range of wavelengths. In UV-Vis experiment (e.g., ExperimentAbsorbanceSpectroscopy, ExperimentUVMelting etc), samples are exposed to the unpolarized light, where its electric and magnetic fields perpendicular oscillate in all directions perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light. In circularly polarized light, the electric field vector rotates around the propagation direction at a constant magnitude, resulting in the electric field vector appearing to trace a circle throughout one wave frequency. Optically active chiral molecules will preferentially absorb one direction of the circularly polarized light. The difference in absorption of the left and right circularly polarized light can be measured and quantified as absorption bands. CD spectroscopy can probe the secondary structure composition of polypeptides/proteins and determine the tertiary structure class of globular proteins.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a CircularDichroism experiment using an Ekko CD plate reader.Step 1:Samples and blanks are loaded to the plate for reading.Step 2 (optional):the sample volume will be measured by the supersonic method to calculate the pathlength.Step 3:Samples are loaded to the instrument.Step 4:The circular dichroism of samples is measured as ellipticity,based on differential absorption of the left and right circularly polarized light of samples.Step 5:Data is plotted and visualized.



Instrumentation

Ekko

Model[Instrument, PlateReader, "id:mnk9jORmGjEw"]

Figure 2.1.1: In an Ekko CD Microplate Reader, a Xenon Lamp emits the full-spectrum light. The light is then split and diffracted into several beams by passing a grating monochromator to emit non-polarized light. The non-polarized light then passes the polarizer to generate linear polarized light. The linear polarized light then passes through the photoelastic modulator to create both left- and right-hand circular polarized light. Finally, the differential absorbed circularly polarized light. The transmitted light is then directed through a prism that splits the beam into wavelengths from 185 nm to 900 nm as measured by the detector.

Default Value: Automatic

Default Calculation: Automatically resolves based on the EnantiomericExcessWavelength first: If EnantiomericExcessWavelength is specified, resolved to be the same as EnantiomericExcessWavelength. If EnantiomericExcessWavelength is blank, this option resolves based on Analytes option: if Analytes are specified as biomacromolecules (Proteins, Peptides, Oligomers), resolves this option to Span[200 Nanometer, 400 Nanometer]; Else resolved to Span[300 Nanometer, 800 Nanometer].

Pattern Description: Multiple or Range or Single.

Example Calls

Basics

Measuring the circular dichroism in specific wavelength range or at some specific wavelengths

ExperimentCircularDichroism[mySamples,

 	DetectionWavelength -> {

   		Span[200 * Nanometer, 330 * Nanometer],

   		{220 * Nanometer, 260 * Nanometer, 310 * Nanometer}

   	}

 ]

Use Blanks and BlankVolume options to specify the unique blank buffer during the experiment.

ExperimentCircularDichroism[mySamples,

 	Blanks -> Model[Sample, "Methanol"],

 	BlankVolume -> (250 * Microliter)

 ]

Molar Ellipticity

The resulting spectra are in ellipticity (mdeg). To generate data in molar ellipticity, specify the CalculatingMolarEllipticitySpectrum, Analyte, AnalyteConcentration in order to auto calculate the molar ellipticity in resulting spectra.

Preferred Input Containers

All data collection is preferred to use a quartz plate. Note the quartz plates are reusable, so samples need to be transferred to ContainerOut to save the sample after the experiment.

Data collection at a visible wavelength region (400 nm to 900 nm) can use standard SBS shallow well plates.



Data Processing

The data can be viewed by PlotCircularDichroism:

PlotCircularDichroism[

 	PlotRange -> {{230, 340}, Automatic}

 ]

Possible Issues

Absorbance Saturation

Similar to UV-Vis spectroscopy, if the absorbance intensity is higher than 1 Abs Unit at a wavelength or a wavelength range, the ellipticity (mdeg) collected at those wavelengths are inaccurate.

[end summary 1]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning for drug discovery. Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptide-based therapeutics for a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentCircularDichroism protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentCircularDichroism[<options>] where you fill in <options> with the appropriate options. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context. In general, leave most options at their default values (and therefore do not specify them) except for those options that should be changed based on your specific experimental design. For every option that you do specify, please explain why you chose that value.

Medicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Medicinal Chemist

To implement the `ExperimentCircularDichroism` protocol using Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL), we need to specify the options that align with our experimental design for peptide-based therapeutics. Below is the experiment setup with explanations for each specified option:

```plaintext
ExperimentCircularDichroism[
    mySamples,
    DetectionWavelength -> Span[190 * Nanometer, 260 * Nanometer],
    CalculatingMolarEllipticitySpectrum -> True,
    Analyte -> {
        Model[Molecule, "id:dORYzZJNK955"],
        Model[Molecule, "id:J8AY5jDB0nlE"],
        Model[Molecule, "id:J8AY5jDB0nlE"]
    },
    AnalyteConcentration -> {1.1 * Micromolar, 1.2 * Micromolar, 1.3 * Micromolar},
    BlankAbsorbance -> True,
    Blanks -> Model[Sample, "Milli-Q water"],
    BlankVolume -> (250 * Microliter),
    NumberOfReplicates -> 3
]
```

### Explanation of Specified Options:

1. **DetectionWavelength -> Span[190 * Nanometer, 260 * Nanometer]**: 
   - **Reason**: This range is chosen to cover the typical wavelengths used for analyzing the secondary structure of peptides. It allows us to capture the relevant CD signals for alpha-helices and beta-sheets.

2. **CalculatingMolarEllipticitySpectrum -> True**: 
   - **Reason**: We want to obtain the molar ellipticity to better understand the structural characteristics of the peptides, which is crucial for assessing their potential as therapeutics.

3. **Analyte**: 
   - **Reason**: Specific molecules are identified by their IDs, which are necessary for the ECL system to recognize and process the samples correctly. These IDs correspond to the peptides being tested.

4. **AnalyteConcentration -> {1.1 * Micromolar, 1.2 * Micromolar, 1.3 * Micromolar}**: 
   - **Reason**: Specifying the concentration of each analyte ensures accurate calculation of molar ellipticity and helps in comparing the structural stability across different concentrations.

5. **BlankAbsorbance -> True**: 
   - **Reason**: Including blank absorbance measurements helps in correcting for any background noise or interference, ensuring more accurate data.

6. **Blanks -> Model[Sample, "Milli-Q water"]**: 
   - **Reason**: Milli-Q water is used as a blank to provide a baseline measurement for absorbance, which is standard practice in CD experiments.

7. **BlankVolume -> (250 * Microliter)**: 
   - **Reason**: This volume is chosen to match the sample volume, ensuring consistent and reliable blank measurements.

8. **NumberOfReplicates -> 3**: 
   - **Reason**: Performing the experiment in triplicate increases the reliability of the results and allows for statistical analysis of the data.

This setup ensures that we gather comprehensive data on the secondary structure of our peptide samples, which is essential for validating their potential as therapeutics. The use of ECL for this experiment aligns with our project goals by providing a robust platform for experimental validation within the 3-month timeframe.
