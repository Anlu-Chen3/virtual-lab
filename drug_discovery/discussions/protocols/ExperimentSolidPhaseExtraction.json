Because of the different affinity between the compounds in the liquid mixture (known as the mobile phase) and the solid sorbent (known as the stationary phase). In case of positive strategy SPE, the desired analytes are retained on the stationary phase while the mobile phase passes through the resin sorbent packed in the SPE cartridge. The analytes of interest are then removed from the cartridge and collected into the desired eluent for downstream analysis. On the other hand, for negative strategy SPE, the contaminants are retained on the stationary phase, while the desired analytes pass through the resin sorbent with the mobile phase.On the whole, SPE can be used to purify different samples and isolate or concentration analytes of interest from a wide variety of matrices.\n\nExperimental Principles\nFigure 1.1: Procedural overview of a Positive ExtractionStrategy of Experiment Solid Phase Extraction (SPE). Step 1 (Optional): The ExtractionCartridge is flushed with PreFlushingSolution (optional) to remove any residues from the packed sorbent prior to start of the protocol. Step 2 (Optional): The ExtractionCartridge is rinsed with ConditioningSolution (optional) to wet and condition the sorbent in order to ensure consistent interaction between the stationary phase and the sample. Step 3: The sample is introduced into the ExtractionCartridge to allow the interaction between the components in the sample and the sorbent. If multiple samples are combined into a pool for solid phase extraction experiment, they are dispensed into the same cartridge in a stepwise fashion. Step 4 (Optional): WashingSolution is transferred into the ExtractionCartridge to elute any contaminants out of the cartridge prior to elution of the components of interest. Step 5 - 6 (Optional): Additional SecondaryWashingSolution and TertiaryWashingSolution can be transferred into the ExtractionCartridge to further wash contaminants out of the resin to increase purity of the eluent. Step 7 (Optional): ElutingSolution is transferred into the ExtractionCartridge to disrupt the interaction between the sample and the sorbent and elute the desired analytes into the collection container.\nFigure 1.2: Procedural overview of a Negative ExtractionStrategy of Experiment Solid Phase Extraction (SPE). Step 1 (Optional): The ExtractionCartridge is flushed with PreFlushingSolution (optional) to remove any residues from the packed sorbent prior to start of the protocol. Step 2 (Optional): The ExtractionCartridge is rinsed with ConditioningSolution to wet and condition the sorbent in order to ensure consistent interaction between the stationary phase and the sample. Step 3: The sample is introduced into the ExtractionCartridge to allow the interaction between the contaminants to bind with the sorbent, while desired analytes pass through the resin sorbent and are collected as SamplesOut. If multiple samples are combined into a pool for solid phase extraction experiment, they are dispensed into the same cartridge in stepwise fashion.\n\nInstrumentation\nGX-271 for Solid Phase Extraction\nModel[Instrument, LiquidHandler, \"id:o1k9jAKOwLl8\"]\nFigure 2.1.1: A 6-port valve syringe pump system is connected to a robotic arm controlled needle in the liquid handler to aspirate and dispense reagents and apply gas toward the sorbent packed ExtractionCartridges for solid-phase extraction of the desired analytes from the samples. Sequentially in each step of the SPE experiment process, Sequentially in each steps of SPE process PreFlushingSolution (Optional), ConditioningSolution (Optional), SamplesIn, WashingSolution (Optional), SecondaryWashingSolution (Optional), TertiaryWashingSolution (Optional) and ElutingSolution (Optional) are aspirated into the syringe from their original containers and then dispensed into the SPE Cartridges via positive displacement of the syringe to allow thorough interaction between the corresponding buffer or sample with the sorbent resin bed in the cartridge. Gas is then applied through the needle to elute the mobile phase into either Waste container or SamplesOut container, depending on the step in the SPE experiment process. The collected SamplesOut are stored for downstream experiments.\nEppendorf 5920R\nModel[Instrument, Centrifuge, \"id:eGakldJEz14E\"]\nFigure 2.2.1: Samples to be centrifuged are counterbalanced in available centrifuge bucket slots. The centrifuge spins the buckets around the axis of the main rotor, while applying optional cooling to prevent a buildup of heat caused by the friction of spinning the rotor. As the samples spin, they are exposed to a centrifugal force that is significantly larger than typical gravitational acceleration. The samples can subsequently be collected at the end of the experiment.\nFilter Block\nModel[Instrument, FilterBlock, \"id:rea9jl1orrGr\"]\nFigure 2.3.1: Instrument diagram for the Filter Block: A filter plate containing sample is positioned inside of a collar which fits over a collection plate within the vacuum manifold. A vacuum generates a pressure gradient that causes the sample to flow through the filter into the collection vessel.\nBiotage PRESSURE+ 48 Positive Pressure Manifold\nModel[Instrument, PressureManifold, \"id:zGj91a7mElrL\"]\nFigure 2.4.1: A positive pressure manifold that use a compressed gas both to seal the Extractioncartridge and displace reagents, designed specifically 3 mL and 6mL tabless vacuum ExtractionCartridge. Sequentially in each steps of SPE process PreFlushingSolution (Optional), ConditioningSolution (Optional), SamplesIn, WashingSolution (Optional), SecondaryWashingSolution (Optional), TertiaryWashingSolution (Optional) and ElutingSolution (Optional) are manually aspirated by operators and then dispensed on to ExtractionCartridge. Afterwards, the pressure manifold then manually lowered to seal with ExtractionCartridge and positive pressure is applied to the reagents in ExtractionCartridge to pass through ExtractionSorbent. The flowthrough reagents from each steps can be collected in 15 mL conical tube and stored for downstream experiments or discarded.\n\nExperiment Options\nGeneral\nSampleLabel\nThe label of the source

In case SamplesIn are not in the plate, they will be transferred to the plate, prior to SPE.\n\nPossible Issues\nSample Loss\nIf LoadingSampleDispenseRates are too high or the LoadingSampleVolume is too large, analytes of interest may break through the cartridge during the loading step, leading to sample loss.\nSPE Plate Dripping\nWhen unstacked SPE plates are moved or manipulated without their collection plates in a robotic sample preparation, the eluted material may drip onto the liquid handler deck, leading to sample loss.\nInsufficient Elution\nWhen the affinity between the ElutingSolution and the compounds of interest is not high and a small ElutingSolutionVolume is used, the samples may not be sufficiently eluted from the Cartridge during the Eluting step, leading to sample loss.\nInsufficient Wash\nWhen the WashingSolutionVolume is too low, the impurities in SamplesIn matrix might not be washed out from ExtractionCartridge, leading to contamination of impurities in SamplesOut when finally eluted from ExtractionCartridge.\nAir Gap Collapse (Gilson GX-271)\nThe system tends to work well with aqueous solutions, but some organic solutions can collapse the air gap that the system fluid uses to drive solutions through the system. This can lead to unanticipated mixing of the organic solutions and the system buffer, causing the machine to falter in delivering volume and pressure to the column.\n\n[end context 1]\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\n### Comprehensive Protocol for Peptide Synthesis and Validation\n\nThis protocol integrates the best components from previous summaries to ensure a detailed, efficient, and scientifically rigorous approach to peptide synthesis and validation, aligned with the project's goals and constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Peptide Synthesis Protocol\n\n#### Step 1: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentPeptideSynthesis`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Fmoc-protected amino acids: 0.1 M in NMP, stored at 4\u00b0C\n  - Rink amide resin: 1 g, 0.1 mmol/g loading capacity\n  - Coupling reagents: HBTU (0.1 M in DMF), DIPEA (2 M in NMP)\n  - Deprotection agent: 20% piperidine in DMF, freshly prepared\n- **Equipment**: \n  - Automated peptide synthesizer, calibrated for accurate volume delivery\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Resin swelling in DMF for 30 minutes\n  - Coupling: 5 mL amino acid solution, 5 mL HBTU, 2 mL DIPEA, stir for 60 minutes\n  - Deprotection: 10 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 minutes, repeated\n  - Washing: Three washes with 10 mL DMF after each step\n- **Output**: Peptide-resin with confirmed coupling efficiency via HPLC\n\n**Quality Control**:\n- **Coupling Check**: Perform Kaiser test after each coupling step\n- **Documentation**: Record reagent batch numbers, conditions, and deviations\n\n#### Step 2: Cleavage and Deprotection\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentCleavage`\n- **Inputs**:\n  - Cleavage cocktail: TFA:water:triisopropylsilane:ethyl methyl sulfide (95:2.5:1:1.5), 10 mL per gram of resin\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Cleavage at room temperature for 2-3 hours\n- **Output**: Crude peptide in solution\n\n#### Step 3: Purification\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentSolidPhaseExtraction` and `ExperimentHPLC`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Crude peptide solution\n  - Solvent system: 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile-water gradient\n- **Equipment**: \n  - SPE apparatus and HPLC system with C18 column\n- **Conditions**: \n  - SPE: Gradient from 5% to 95% acetonitrile over 30 minutes\n  - HPLC: Flow rate 1 mL/min, UV detection at 214 nm\n- **Output**: Purified peptide >90% purity\n\n#### Step 4: Mass Confirmation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentLCMS`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Purified peptide\n- **Equipment**: \n  - LC-MS system\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Standard LCMS settings for peptide analysis\n- **Output**: Confirmed molecular weight and sequence identity\n\n#### Step 5: Chemical Modifications\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentBioconjugation`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - Purified peptide (0.4 mmol)\n  - PEG reagent (0.48 mmol)\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Room temperature, stirring for 2 hours in PBS\n- **Output**: Modified peptide, confirmed by MS\n\n### Peptide Validation Protocol\n\n#### Structural Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentNMR` and `ExperimentCircularDichroism`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - PBS buffer (pH 7.4)\n- **Equipment**: \n  - NMR spectrometer and CD spectrometer\n- **Conditions**: \n  - NMR: Proton and COSY 2D in DMSO-d6\n  - CD: 190-260 nm at 25\u00b0C\n- **Output**: Structural integrity and secondary structure confirmation\n\n#### Binding Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentBioLayerInterferometry` and `ExperimentFluorescencePolarization`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - Target protein: 1 mg/mL in PBS\n- **Equipment**: \n  - BLI instrument and fluorescence polarization reader\n- **Conditions**: \n  - BLI: Measure kinetics at peptide concentrations from 1 nM to 1 \u00b5M\n  - FP: Label peptide with FITC, measure binding across concentrations\n- **Output**: Binding affinity (expected KD <10 nM) and kinetic data\n\n#### Functional Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentELISA`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies\n- **Equipment**: \n  - ELISA plate reader\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Standard ELISA protocol\n- **Output**: Quantitative binding data\n\n#### Stability Validation\n- **Experiment**: `ExperimentThermalShift`\n- **Inputs**: \n  - PEGylated peptide\n  - Sypro Orange dye\n- **Equipment**: \n  - Real-time PCR thermal cycler\n- **Conditions**: \n  - Heat and record fluorescence to determine melting temperature\n- **Output**: Thermal stability profile\n\n### Integration with Machine Learning Models\n\n- **Data Handling and Feedback**: Collect binding affinity, structural data, and stability profiles to feed back into machine learning models (ProteinMPNN and RFDiffusion).
