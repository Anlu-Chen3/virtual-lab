A sample is inserted into a magnetic field, which causes select nuclei (most commonly 1H and 13C) to absorb radio-frequency radiation. The frequency at which this occurs, and the intensity of this absorption, is proportional to the magnetic field around each nucleus. This magnetic field is heavily dependent on the chemical environment, and so each nucleus will give a characteristic signal depending on its surroundings. This produces a spectrum that allows identification of known molecules or the characterization of the structure of unknown ones.\n\nExperimental Principles\nFigure 1.1: Step 1: Sample is dissolved in specified NMRSolvent. Step 2: Samples are transferred into NMR tubes. Step 3: The tubes are loaded onto the NMR instrument. Step 4: The spectrum is collected for each of the samples. Step 5 (optional): The data is assessed using AnalyzePeaks.\n\nInstrumentation\nAscend 500\nModel[Instrument, NMR, \"id:6V0npvK61r8q\"]\nFigure 2.1.1: Samples in NMR tubes are lowered into the bore of the NMR instrument. A superconducting magnet cooled by liquid helium generates a strong magnetic field (11.7 T) that surrounds the sample and aligns the spin states of its nuclei. A radio-frequency pulse is applied to the sample which excites the nuclear spin states of the desired nucleus. Once the pulse is turned off, the excited spins emit a decaying rf signal known as a free induction decay (FID) as they return to equilibrium. Because the environment of each nucleus differs, the nature of this FID allows for the characterization of the structure of the provided sample.\n\nExperiment Options\nSample Parameters\nNucleus\nThe nucleus whose spins will be recorded in this experiment.\nDefault Value: 1H\nPattern Description: 1H, 13C, 19F, or 31P.\nProgrammatic Pattern: Nucleus1DP\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\nDeuteratedSolvent\nThe deuterated solvent in which the provided samples will be dissolved in prior to taking their spectra (or, if the samples are already in the NMR tube, what solvent was used to dissolve them).\nDefault Value: Automatic\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"] if UseExternalStandard is True, otherwise set to Model[Sample, \"Deuterium oxide\"].\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Sample] or Object[Sample] or a prepared sample or Water, Chloroform, DMSO, Benzene, Acetone, Acetonitrile, or Methanol.\nProgrammatic Pattern: (DeuteratedSolventP | (ObjectP[{Model[Sample], Object[Sample]}] | _String)) | Automatic\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\nUseExternalStandard\nIndicate if an external standard is used in this experiment. For example, in an NMR experiment, an external standard is stored separately in a coaxial insert (sealed or not) inserted into the NMR tube.

For now, we only support one sealed coaxial insert: Model[Container,Vessel,\"3mm NMR Sealed Coaxial Insert with 3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 in Deuterium Oxide\"].\nDefault Value: Automatic\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to True if SealedCoaxialInsert is specified.

Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptide-based therapeutics for a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentNMR protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentNMR[<options>] where you fill in <options> with the appropriate options. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context. In general, leave most options at their default values (and therefore do not specify them) except for those options that should be changed based on your specific experimental design. For every option that you do specify, please explain why you chose that value.\n\nMedicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To implement the `ExperimentNMR` protocol using Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for the validation of peptide-based therapeutics, we need to carefully select the options that align with our experimental design. Here is the proposed command with explanations for each specified option:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentNMR[\n    Object[Sample, \"id:yourSampleID\"],\n    Nucleus -> \"1H\",\n    DeuteratedSolvent -> DMSO,\n    SampleAmount -> 5 Milligram,\n    SolventVolume -> 700 Microliter,\n    AcquisitionTime -> 4 Second,\n    NumberOfScans -> 16\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **Object[Sample, \"id:yourSampleID\"]**: \n   - This specifies the sample to be analyzed. Replace `\"id:yourSampleID\"` with the actual ID of your peptide sample in ECL.\n\n2. **Nucleus -> \"1H\"**:\n   - We are interested in obtaining the proton NMR spectrum, which is commonly used for structural validation of organic compounds, including peptides. This option is crucial for identifying the chemical environment of hydrogen atoms in the peptide.\n\n3. **DeuteratedSolvent -> DMSO**:\n   - DMSO is chosen as the deuterated solvent because it is a common solvent for peptides, providing good solubility and a clear spectrum. This choice helps in obtaining a high-quality NMR spectrum without interference from solvent peaks.\n\n4. **SampleAmount -> 5 Milligram**:\n   - This amount is typically sufficient for obtaining a clear NMR signal while conserving sample material. It aligns with standard practices for NMR sample preparation.\n\n5. **SolventVolume -> 700 Microliter**:\n   - A solvent volume of 700 \u03bcL is recommended to ensure proper shimming and optimal signal quality. This volume is standard for NMR experiments to avoid issues with peak tailing and resolution.\n\n6. **AcquisitionTime -> 4 Second**:\n   - This acquisition time is suitable for 1H NMR, allowing for adequate signal averaging and resolution. It is a default setting that balances time and data quality.\n\n7. **NumberOfScans -> 16**:\n   - A total of 16 scans is chosen to provide a good signal-to-noise ratio for 1H NMR, which is typically sufficient for structural analysis of peptides.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Default Values**: Most other parameters are left at their default values, as they are generally optimized for typical NMR experiments and do not require adjustment unless specific experimental conditions dictate otherwise.\n- **ECL Integration**: Ensure that all experimental data is managed and stored within ECL, facilitating integration with machine learning models and maintaining a feedback loop for continuous improvement.\n\nThis setup should provide a robust NMR experiment for validating the structure of the peptide-based therapeutics, aligning with the project's goals of high clinical value and scientific impact."
