A sample is inserted into a magnetic field, which causes select nuclei (most commonly 1H and 13C) to absorb radio-frequency radiation. The frequency at which this occurs, and the intensity of this absorption, is proportional to the magnetic field around each nucleus. This magnetic field is heavily dependent on the chemical environment, and so each nucleus will give a characteristic signal depending on its surroundings. This produces a spectrum that allows identification of known molecules or the characterization of the structure of unknown ones.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Step 1: Sample is dissolved in specified NMRSolvent. Step 2: Samples are transferred into NMR tubes. Step 3: The tubes are loaded onto the NMR instrument. Step 4: The spectrum is collected for each of the samples. Step 5 (optional): The data is assessed using AnalyzePeaks.\n\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\nAscend 500\n\nModel[Instrument, NMR, \"id:6V0npvK61r8q\"]\n\nFigure 2.1.1: Samples in NMR tubes are lowered into the bore of the NMR instrument. A superconducting magnet cooled by liquid helium generates a strong magnetic field (11.7 T) that surrounds the sample and aligns the spin states of its nuclei. A radio-frequency pulse is applied to the sample which excites the nuclear spin states of the desired nucleus. Once the pulse is turned off, the excited spins emit a decaying rf signal known as a free induction decay (FID) as they return to equilibrium. Because the environment of each nucleus differs, the nature of this FID allows for the characterization of the structure of the provided sample.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nSample Parameters\n\nNucleus\n\nThe nucleus whose spins will be recorded in this experiment.\n\nDefault Value: 1H\n\nPattern Description: 1H, 13C, 19F, or 31P.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: Nucleus1DP\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nDeuteratedSolvent\n\nThe deuterated solvent in which the provided samples will be dissolved in prior to taking their spectra (or, if the samples are already in the NMR tube, what solvent was used to dissolve them).\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"] if UseExternalStandard is True, otherwise set to Model[Sample, \"Deuterium oxide\"].\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Sample] or Object[Sample] or a prepared sample or Water, Chloroform, DMSO, Benzene, Acetone, Acetonitrile, or Methanol.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (DeuteratedSolventP | (ObjectP[{Model[Sample], Object[Sample]}] | _String)) | Automatic\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nUseExternalStandard\n\nIndicate if an external standard is used in this experiment.

Peptides offer specificity in targeting protein-protein interactions, which aligns with our goal of applying machine learning to optimize sequence design and target interactions. We will employ machine learning techniques such as sequence optimization algorithms and structure prediction models (e.g., AlphaFold) to enhance peptide design. The integration will involve a structured feedback loop where computational predictions are iteratively validated and refined through experimental data from ECL. Success will be measured by improvements in binding affinity, structural stability, and bioavailability, with each iteration aiming to enhance these metrics.\n\n2. **What specific disease/target pairs are you proposing to treat with your choice of drug modality (list five)?**\n\n   **Answer**: \n   1. Type 2 Diabetes - GLP-1 Receptor\n   2. Cancer - PD-1/PD-L1\n   3. Alzheimer's Disease - Amyloid-beta\n   4. Antimicrobial Resistance - MurA/B\n   5. Cardiovascular Diseases - PCSK9\n\n   **Justification**: These targets are chosen for their clinical relevance and the availability of robust datasets, which are critical for machine learning applications. Peptides are particularly suitable for these targets due to their ability to modulate protein interactions with high specificity. For instance, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown promise in diabetes management, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy. Peptides can address the challenges of specificity and delivery in these contexts, offering unique therapeutic insights. Expected outcomes include improved binding affinity and stability of peptides, which will be validated through assays such as HPLC and LCMS at ECL. Potential risks, such as off-target effects and peptide degradation, will be mitigated through careful design and chemical modifications.\n\n3. **Why are these diseases and targets appropriate for your choice of drug modality?**\n\n   **Answer**: These diseases present high unmet medical needs and involve targets that can be effectively modulated by peptides. The availability of existing data supports model training, and ECL can facilitate rapid empirical validation. Peptides offer advantages in specificity, and the selected targets allow for the integration of machine learning with experimental validation within the given timeframe. For example, peptides targeting amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's can potentially disrupt plaque formation, while those targeting MurA/B can inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, addressing antimicrobial resistance. Preliminary studies and literature support the feasibility of peptide interventions for these targets, providing a strong foundation for our approach. Specific challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Begin by collecting and preprocessing data from relevant databases such as PDB, BindingDB, and UniProt to train machine learning models focusing on peptide interactions with selected targets. Ensure data quality and relevance through rigorous auditing.\n\n2. **Model Development and Validation**: Develop interpretable machine learning models using sequence-based and structure-based approaches. Employ frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development, incorporating techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance metrics. Validate models through iterative feedback loops with experimental data from ECL. Evaluation criteria will include binding affinity predictions, structural stability, and experimental validation outcomes.\n\n3. **Pilot Studies at ECL**: Conduct pilot studies to empirically validate key peptide modifications like cyclization, focusing on the most promising targets. Use these studies to inform model refinement and enhance prediction accuracy. Criteria for target selection will include clinical relevance, data availability, and preliminary computational predictions. Potential challenges, such as peptide solubility and stability, will be addressed through chemical modifications and formulation strategies.\n\n4. **Phased Implementation**: Implement a phased approach to focus initially on one or two high-priority targets to ensure feasibility within the timeline. Iterate based on learnings and expand to additional targets as data and insights accumulate.\n\n5. **Regular Review and Adaptation**: Schedule regular team meetings to review progress, discuss results, and adapt the project plan based on emerging data and insights.

This workflow aims to maximize clinical value, scientific impact, and feasibility within a 3-month timeframe.\n\n### Answers\n\n1. **What experiments in order will you run to synthesize the peptides in preparation for validation?**\n\n   **Answer**: \n   - **ExperimentPeptideSynthesis**\n   - **ExperimentBioconjugation** (if necessary, based on computational predictions indicating the need for enhanced stability or solubility, such as PEGylation or cyclization)\n   - **ExperimentSolidPhaseExtraction**\n   - **ExperimentHPLC**\n   - **ExperimentLCMS**\n\n   **Justification**: This sequence ensures that peptides are synthesized, modified if needed, purified, and confirmed for sequence integrity before validation. Bioconjugation will be applied based on specific computational outputs, such as predicted instability or solubility issues, identified through machine learning models that analyze peptide properties. Solid-phase extraction targets impurities like unreacted reagents and by-products, ensuring a clean sample for validation.\n\n2. **What is the role of each experiment in the synthesis workflow?**\n\n   **Answer**:\n   - **ExperimentPeptideSynthesis**: Synthesizes the designed peptide sequences.\n   - **ExperimentBioconjugation**: Modifies peptides to enhance properties such as stability and binding affinity, applied based on computational predictions. Modifications like PEGylation or cyclization are considered to improve solubility and resistance to proteolysis.\n   - **ExperimentSolidPhaseExtraction**: Purifies the synthesized peptides by removing impurities such as unreacted reagents and by-products, ensuring a clean sample for further analysis.\n   - **ExperimentHPLC**: Analyzes the purity of the peptides, ensuring they meet the required standards for further validation.\n   - **ExperimentLCMS**: Confirms the mass and structural integrity of the peptides post-synthesis, ensuring they match the designed sequences with specific mass accuracy thresholds, typically within \u00b10.1 Da for small peptides.\n\n3. **What experiments will you perform to validate the synthesized peptides?**\n\n   **Answer**:\n   - **ExperimentLCMS** (initial, to confirm purity and identity)\n   - **ExperimentCircularDichroism**\n   - **ExperimentBioLayerInterferometry**\n   - **ExperimentThermalShift**\n\n   **Justification**: These experiments allow comprehensive validation of structural, functional, and stability aspects of peptides, aligned with our clinical and scientific goals.

        "message": "To implement the ExperimentNMR protocol using Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL), we need to design an experiment that aligns with our peptide-based therapeutics project. The goal is to obtain NMR spectra for the synthesized peptides to confirm their structure and purity. Below is the experiment setup using the ECL syntax, along with explanations for each specified option:\n\n### ExperimentNMR Setup\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentNMR[\n    Object[Sample, \"id:sampleID\"], \n    Nucleus -> \"1H\", \n    DeuteratedSolvent -> \"DMSO\", \n    SampleAmount -> 5 * Milligram, \n    SolventVolume -> 700 * Microliter\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options\n\n1. **Nucleus**\n   - **Default Value**: \"1H\"\n   - **Chosen Value**: \"1H\"\n   - **Reason**: We are interested in obtaining the proton NMR spectrum, which is standard for initial structural confirmation of organic compounds, including peptides.\n\n2. **DeuteratedSolvent**\n   - **Default Value**: Automatic (Deuterium oxide if no external standard is used)\n   - **Chosen Value**: \"DMSO\"\n   - **Reason**: DMSO is chosen as the solvent because it is a common solvent for peptides, providing good solubility and minimal interference in the NMR spectrum. It is also useful for observing amide protons, which are crucial for peptide structure confirmation.\n\n3. **SampleAmount**\n   - **Default Value**: Automatic (set to the smaller of 5 mg or the full mass of the sample if a solid)\n   - **Chosen Value**: 5 * Milligram\n   - **Reason**: Specifying 5 mg ensures that we have a sufficient amount of sample to obtain a clear spectrum without overwhelming the solvent signal.\n\n4. **SolventVolume**\n   - **Default Value**: Automatic (set to ensure total volume is 700 \u03bcL if not already in an NMR tube)\n   - **Chosen Value**: 700 * Microliter\n   - **Reason**: A solvent volume of 700 \u03bcL is standard for NMR experiments, ensuring optimal shimming and signal quality. This volume is sufficient to dissolve the peptide sample and fill the NMR tube adequately.\n\n### Justification for Using Defaults\n\nFor other parameters such as NumberOfScans, AcquisitionTime, and RelaxationDelay, the default values are appropriate for a standard 1H NMR experiment. These defaults are optimized for typical samples and provide a balance between data quality and experiment duration.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis setup ensures that we obtain high-quality NMR data for our peptide samples, which is crucial for confirming their structure and purity. The choice of solvent and sample amount is tailored to the specific needs of peptide analysis, while other parameters are left at their defaults to leverage ECL's optimized settings. This approach aligns with our project goals of high clinical value and scientific impact, using ECL for experimental validation within the 3-month timeframe."
