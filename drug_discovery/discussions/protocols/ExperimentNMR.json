A sample is inserted into a magnetic field, which causes select nuclei (most commonly 1H and 13C) to absorb radio-frequency radiation. The frequency at which this occurs, and the intensity of this absorption, is proportional to the magnetic field around each nucleus. This magnetic field is heavily dependent on the chemical environment, and so each nucleus will give a characteristic signal depending on its surroundings. This produces a spectrum that allows identification of known molecules or the characterization of the structure of unknown ones.\n\n\n\nExperimental Principles\n\nFigure 1.1: Step 1: Sample is dissolved in specified NMRSolvent. Step 2: Samples are transferred into NMR tubes. Step 3: The tubes are loaded onto the NMR instrument. Step 4: The spectrum is collected for each of the samples. Step 5 (optional): The data is assessed using AnalyzePeaks.\n\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\nAscend 500\n\nModel[Instrument, NMR, \"id:6V0npvK61r8q\"]\n\nFigure 2.1.1: Samples in NMR tubes are lowered into the bore of the NMR instrument. A superconducting magnet cooled by liquid helium generates a strong magnetic field (11.7 T) that surrounds the sample and aligns the spin states of its nuclei. A radio-frequency pulse is applied to the sample which excites the nuclear spin states of the desired nucleus. Once the pulse is turned off, the excited spins emit a decaying rf signal known as a free induction decay (FID) as they return to equilibrium. Because the environment of each nucleus differs, the nature of this FID allows for the characterization of the structure of the provided sample.\n\n\n\nExperiment Options\n\nSample Parameters\n\nNucleus\n\nThe nucleus whose spins will be recorded in this experiment.\n\nDefault Value: 1H\n\nPattern Description: 1H, 13C, 19F, or 31P.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: Nucleus1DP\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nDeuteratedSolvent\n\nThe deuterated solvent in which the provided samples will be dissolved in prior to taking their spectra (or, if the samples are already in the NMR tube, what solvent was used to dissolve them).\n\nDefault Value: Automatic\n\nDefault Calculation: Automatically set to Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"] if UseExternalStandard is True, otherwise set to Model[Sample, \"Deuterium oxide\"].\n\nPattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Sample] or Object[Sample] or a prepared sample or Water, Chloroform, DMSO, Benzene, Acetone, Acetonitrile, or Methanol.\n\nProgrammatic Pattern: (DeuteratedSolventP | (ObjectP[{Model[Sample], Object[Sample]}] | _String)) | Automatic\n\nIndex Matches to: experiment samples\n\nUseExternalStandard\n\nIndicate if an external standard is used in this experiment.

Your goals are the following: (1) the project must have high clinical value, meaning the research contributes to helping patients, (2) the project must include a scientifically impactful application of machine learning to drug discovery, and (3) the project must use Emerald Cloud Labs (ECL) for all experimental validation with a 3-month limit on experiments. Your team previously decided to pursue peptide-based therapeutics. You previously designed experimental protocols for synthesis and validation of peptides that are designed to bind to a given protein drug target. Now you must implement one of these protocols using ECL. Please implement the ExperimentNMR protocol using the appropriate commands and syntax from ECL, writing out the experiment in the form ExperimentNMR[<inputs>] where you fill in <inputs> with the appropriate inputs. Please refer to the ECL documentation that is provided as context with example function calls and the full set of options for the experiment. In general, leave most options at their default values (and therefore do not specify them) except for those options that should be changed based on your specific experimental design. For every option that you do specify, please explain why you chose that value instead of the default.\n\nMedicinal Chemist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To implement the `ExperimentNMR` protocol using ECL for the validation of peptide-based therapeutics, we need to carefully select the appropriate inputs and parameters based on our experimental design. Here is a proposed setup for the NMR experiment:\n\n```plaintext\nExperimentNMR[\n    Object[Sample, \"id:yourSampleID\"],  // Replace with actual sample ID\n    Nucleus -> \"1H\",  // We are interested in proton NMR for structural validation\n    DeuteratedSolvent -> DMSO,  // DMSO is chosen for its ability to dissolve peptides well\n    SampleAmount -> 5 Milligram,  // A typical amount for NMR analysis\n    SolventVolume -> 700 Microliter,  // Ensures proper shimming and resolution\n    SampleTemperature -> Ambient,  // Default ambient temperature is suitable for initial analysis\n    NumberOfScans -> 64  // Increased from default to improve signal-to-noise ratio\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of Specified Options:\n\n1. **Nucleus -> \"1H\"**: Proton NMR is selected because it provides detailed information about the hydrogen environment in the peptide, which is crucial for structural validation.\n\n2. **DeuteratedSolvent -> DMSO**: DMSO is chosen as the solvent because it is excellent for dissolving peptides, ensuring that the sample is in a suitable state for NMR analysis. The default solvent is Deuterium Oxide, which may not dissolve all peptides effectively.\n\n3. **SampleAmount -> 5 Milligram**: This amount is typical for NMR analysis, providing a sufficient concentration for obtaining a clear spectrum without overwhelming the detector.\n\n4. **SolventVolume -> 700 Microliter**: This volume is recommended to ensure proper shimming and resolution. It prevents issues with peak tailing and ensures the instrument can lock onto the solvent's deuterium signal effectively.\n\n5. **NumberOfScans -> 64**: Increasing the number of scans from the default improves the signal-to-noise ratio, which is beneficial for detecting subtle features in the spectrum that are important for structural validation.\n\n### Default Options:\n\n- **SampleTemperature -> Ambient**: The default ambient temperature is suitable for initial analysis unless specific temperature-dependent studies are required.\n- **Other acquisition parameters**: Default values are used unless specific adjustments are needed based on preliminary results or specific experimental goals.\n\nThis setup aligns with our project goals by ensuring that the NMR experiment is designed to provide high-quality data for validating the structural integrity of the synthesized peptides. The use of ECL for this experiment ensures that we can efficiently manage and execute the protocol within the 3-month experimental limit."
