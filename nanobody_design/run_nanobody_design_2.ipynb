    "workflow_questions_agenda = f\"\"\"{background_prompt} {nanobody_prompt} You created a nanobody design workflow that employs ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta to evaluate mutated nanobody candidates for binding to recent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). In particular, AlphaFold-Multimer is run with the mutated nanobody sequence and RBD sequence to predict the structure of the nanobody-RBD complex. By default, AlphaFold-Multimer generates five structural models and ranks them by confidence. Your workflow takes the highest confidence model as the predicted structure and computes the interface pLDDT (ipLDDT) of that structure. Then, Rosetta is applied to relax that best predicted complex structure and compute a binding interface energy (dG_separated) using the REF2015 scoring function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are not deterministic. When given the same nanobody and RBD sequences twice, AlphaFold-Multimer (run using LocalColabFold) computes the same MSA but generates a different set of five structures each time. This can result in dramatically different ipLDDT computations from the top ranked complex structures of two different runs (e.g., ipLDDT = 86.1 vs ipLDDT = 72.6). Similarly, when Rosetta is given the same nanobody-RBD complex structure twice, it computes two different binding energies (e.g., dG_separated = -32.2 vs dG_separated = -31.8). This variability can lead to different rankings of mutated nanobody candidates and different decisions on which candidates to select for experimental validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, please explain why AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are not deterministic and how this non-determinism affects the ipLDDT and dG_separated scores. Second, propose a strategy to address this non-determinism in your nanobody design workflow. Your strategy should aim to reduce the variability in the ipLDDT and dG_separated scores and improve the consistency of the rankings of mutated nanobody candidates without increasing the computational cost.\"\"\"\n",
