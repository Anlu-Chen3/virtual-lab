        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Machine Learning Specialist to discuss your research project.\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\nBased on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:\n\n### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations\nIn each iteration, the order of operations will be:\n- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.\n- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.\n- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.\n\n### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate\n- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.\n- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.\n\n### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking\nAt the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:\n\\[ \\text{Score} = w_1 \\times \\text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \\times \\text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \\times \\text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \\]\n- Initial weights: \\( w_1 = 0.2 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.5 \\), \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.\n\n### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep\n- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.\n\n### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations\n- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.\n\n### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies\n- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.\n- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.\n- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.\n- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.\n- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.\n\n### Explanation of Component Selection\n- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.\n- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).\n- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \\( w_1 = 0.2 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.5 \\), \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.\n- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.\n- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.\n- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.\n\nThis plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.\n\n[end summary 1]\n\n[begin summary 2]\n\n### Revised Answers\n\n1. **Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?**\n\n   - **Answer**: Target both KP.3 and JN.1 RBDs.\n   - **Justification**: KP.3 and JN.1 are not only epidemiologically significant but also closely related, enhancing the potential for cross-reactivity and broader neutralization capabilities. To address potential challenges such as future mutations, we will implement regular genomic surveillance and collaborate with epidemiologists to monitor emerging variants. This proactive approach will allow us to adapt our research strategy as needed.\n\n2. **Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?**\n\n   - **Answer**: Nb21 and Ty1.\n   - **Justification**: These nanobodies have demonstrated enhanced binding profiles in the ELISA results, making them ideal candidates for further improvement. H11-D4 and VHH-72 were excluded because their mutants did not show specific binding to strains other than the Wuhan RBD, and some exhibited non-specific binding. However, if new data suggests improved specificity or if new variants emerge that these nanobodies can target effectively, we will reconsider their inclusion.\n\n3. **How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?**\n\n   - **Answer**: 60 for Nb21 and 32 for Ty1.\n   - **Justification**: The allocation is based on the stronger binding profile of Nb21 mutants across multiple strains, as shown in the ELISA results. Binding strength and specificity were quantitatively assessed by measuring absorbance values in ELISA, with higher values indicating stronger binding. These assessments will guide future iterations of mutant design, ensuring continuous improvement by focusing on enhancing binding affinity and specificity.\n\n4. **Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?**\n\n   - **Answer**: Begin with previously designed mutant nanobodies.\n   - **Justification**: Starting with successful mutants allows us to build on known improvements, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. Success is defined by the ability of mutants to bind specifically to multiple RBDs, as demonstrated in ELISA results, without non-specific binding to BSA. Additional metrics such as binding kinetics and thermodynamic stability will also be considered in future evaluations.\n\n5. **If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?**\n\n   - **Answer**: Start with the Nb21 mutant (I77V, L59E, Q87A, R37Q) and the Ty1 mutant (V32F, G59D, N45S, F32S).\n   - **Justification**: These mutants have shown specific binding improvements and cross-variant potential, making them solid foundations for further modifications. The ELISA results confirm their enhanced binding profiles to JN.1 and KP.3.\n\n6. **Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?**\n\n   - **Answer**: Enhance the existing pipeline with additional simulations and machine learning techniques.\n   - **Justification**: We will integrate molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS and AMBER to evaluate binding interactions and stability, chosen for their robust capabilities in simulating biomolecular systems. Additionally, we will incorporate graph neural networks and ensemble learning to refine predictions of non-specific binding and cross-reactivity, selected for their ability to handle complex data and improve model accuracy. While these techniques are powerful, we will address potential limitations such as computational cost and model interpretability by optimizing simulation parameters and ensuring transparent reporting of model predictions.\n\n### Additional Improvements\n\n- **Strategies for Monitoring Mutations**: By implementing genomic surveillance and collaborating with epidemiologists, we ensure a proactive approach to adapting our research strategy in response to emerging variants.\n\n- **Criteria for Reconsideration of Excluded Nanobodies**: Specifying the types of data or developments that would prompt a reevaluation of H11-D4 and VHH-72 provides clear criteria for their potential inclusion.\n\n- **Informing Future Iterations**: Quantitative assessments of binding will guide future mutant design, focusing on enhancing binding affinity and specificity to ensure continuous improvement.\n\n- **Comprehensive Evaluation of Mutants**: Including additional metrics such as binding kinetics and thermodynamic stability ensures a thorough evaluation process for continuing with successful mutants.\n\n- **Addressing Limitations of Techniques**: By discussing potential limitations and how they will be addressed, we ensure that the pipeline remains robust and adaptable to the project's needs.\n\nBy incorporating these improvements, the revised answer is more detailed, transparent, and aligned with the research project's objectives.\n\n[end summary 2]\n\n[begin summary 3]\n\nBased on the summaries provided and the agenda for this meeting, here is a consolidated response that merges the best components from each individual answer:\n\n### 1. Number of Top Ranked Mutations to Keep for Analysis by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta\n- **Answer**: We will keep the top 50 mutations based on ESM LLR for further analysis using AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta.\n\n### 2. Rationale for Change\n- **Rationale**: This is an increase from the previous top 20 mutations. The rationale for this change is to expand the exploration space in light of the complex nature of binding to multiple RBD variants (JN.1 and KP.3). This allows us to capture a broader range of potential beneficial mutations that may confer enhanced cross-variant binding, considering the moderate binding improvements observed based on ELISA results. This rationale was consistently highlighted across all summaries.\n\n### 3. Formula for Computing Weighted Score (WS)\n- **Answer**: The revised WS formula will be:\n  \\[\n  \\text{WS} = 0.2 \\times \\text{(ESM LLR)} + 0.4 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{AF ipLDDT (JN.1)} + \\text{AF ipLDDT (KP.3)}}{2}\\right) - 0.4 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{RS dG (JN.1)} + \\text{RS dG (KP.3)}}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n- This formula averages the AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta scores across the JN.1 and KP.3 RBDs, giving equal weight to both variants to ensure that nanobodies are optimized for cross-variant binding. This approach was consistently emphasized in summaries 1 and 2.\n\n### 4. Rationale for WS Formula Change\n- **Rationale**: The adjustment is necessary to address the dual-target nature of the project, ensuring that nanobodies are prioritized based on their potential to bind both RBDs effectively. The weights have been adjusted to reflect the heightened importance of achieving cross-variant activity. This rationale was consistently highlighted in summaries 3 and 4.\n\n### 5. Number of Top Ranked Mutated Nanobodies to Select for Next Round\n- **Answer**: We will select the top 10 mutated nanobodies for the next round of mutation.\n\n### 6. Rationale for Change\n- **Rationale**: Previously, we retained 5 mutations per iteration. Increasing this to 10 ensures we capture a broader set of promising candidates, enhancing the likelihood of identifying nanobody variants with strong cross-reactivity and specificity given the additional variants being targeted. This rationale was consistently highlighted across all summaries.\n\n### 7. Number of Rounds of Mutation\n- **Answer**: We will conduct 4 rounds of mutation, starting with the Nb21 and Ty1 mutants.\n\n### 8. Rationale for Change\n- **Rationale**: While 3-4 iterations were initially planned, confirming 4 rounds ensures thorough exploration and refinement, accommodating new insights and adjustments from each round, while aligning with the project's timeline and resource availability. This rationale was consistently highlighted in summaries 3 and 4.\n\n**Components Chosen:**\n- **Top Mutations**: The decision to keep the top 50 mutations was consistently recommended across all summaries, emphasizing the need for a broader exploration space.\n- **WS Formula**: The formula from summaries 1 and 2 was chosen for its balanced approach to cross-variant binding, which aligns well with the project's goals.\n- **Selection of Nanobodies**: The choice to select the top 10 nanobodies was a common theme, reflecting the need to maintain diversity and leverage new insights.\n- **Rounds of Mutation**: The decision to conduct 4 rounds was chosen for its balance between thorough exploration and resource management, as highlighted in summaries 3 and 4.\n\nThese decisions aim to enhance the probability of identifying nanobodies with strong and specific binding to both JN.1 and KP.3 RBDs, while maintaining a focus on computational efficiency and project timelines.\n\n[end summary 3]\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You created a nanobody design workflow that employs ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta to evaluate mutated nanobody candidates for binding to recent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). In particular, AlphaFold-Multimer is run with the mutated nanobody sequence and RBD sequence to predict the structure of the nanobody-RBD complex. By default, AlphaFold-Multimer generates five structural models and ranks them by confidence. Your workflow takes the highest confidence model as the predicted structure and computes the interface pLDDT (ipLDDT) of that structure. Then, Rosetta is applied to relax that best predicted complex structure and compute a binding interface energy (dG_separated) using the REF2015 scoring function.\n\nIt turns out that AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are not deterministic. When given the same nanobody and RBD sequences twice, AlphaFold-Multimer (run using LocalColabFold) computes the same MSA but generates a different set of five structures each time. This can result in dramatically different ipLDDT computations from the top ranked complex structures of two different runs (e.g., ipLDDT = 86.1 vs ipLDDT = 72.6). Similarly, when Rosetta is given the same nanobody-RBD complex structure twice, it computes two different binding energies (e.g., dG_separated = -32.2 vs dG_separated = -31.8). This variability can lead to different rankings of mutated nanobody candidates and different decisions on which candidates to select for experimental validation.\n\nFirst, please explain why AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are not deterministic and how this non-determinism affects the ipLDDT and dG_separated scores. Second, propose a strategy to address this non-determinism in your nanobody design workflow. Your strategy should aim to reduce the variability in the ipLDDT and dG_separated scores and improve the consistency of the rankings of mutated nanobody candidates without increasing the computational cost.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. Why is AlphaFold-Multimer non-deterministic in this workflow, and how does this non-determinism affect the ipLDDT score?\n\n2. Why is Rosetta non-deterministic in this workflow, and how does this non-determinism affect the dG_separated score?\n\n3. How will you change the AlphaFold-Multimer component of the workflow (if at all) to improve ipLDDT score consistency while still only using one AlphaFold-Multimer run (five models)?\n\n4. In your new workflow, what AlphaFold-Multimer complex structure will you use as input to Rosetta?\n\n5. How will you change the Rosetta component of the workflow (if at all) to improve dG_separated score consistency while still only using one Rosetta run on one complex structure?\n\nMachine Learning Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "In addressing the agenda for this meeting, we aim to understand and mitigate the non-deterministic behavior of AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta in the nanobody design workflow. \n\n### 1. Why is AlphaFold-Multimer non-deterministic in this workflow, and how does this non-determinism affect the ipLDDT score?\n\n**Non-determinism in AlphaFold-Multimer:**\nAlphaFold-Multimer's non-determinism arises from several factors: \n- **Random Initialization:** During structure prediction, AlphaFold-Multimer uses stochastic processes for initializing model parameters and embeddings.\n- **Sampling Variability:** The generation of multiple structural models (five by default) involves sampling from a probabilistic distribution, leading to variation in predicted structures.\n- **Neural Network Dynamics:** The neural network architecture inherently includes non-deterministic elements, such as dropout layers, which introduce variability in predictions.\n\n**Effect on ipLDDT:**\nThe ipLDDT score, which measures the confidence of predicted interactions at the interface of the nanobody-RBD complex, can fluctuate significantly between runs due to these stochastic elements. Variability in the highest-confidence structure from different runs directly affects the ipLDDT score, leading to inconsistent rankings of candidate nanobodies.\n\n### 2. Why is Rosetta non-deterministic in this workflow, and how does this non-determinism affect the dG_separated score?\n\n**Non-determinism in Rosetta:**\n- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Rosetta employs Monte Carlo simulations for structure relaxation and energy calculations, which are inherently stochastic.\n- **Random Seed Variability:** The use of different random seeds in different runs can lead to variations in the sampled conformational space.\n- **Local Minima Exploration:** The energy landscape is explored to find local minima, which may vary between runs due to the stochastic nature of the search process.\n\n**Effect on dG_separated:**\nThe dG_separated score, reflecting binding interface energy, can vary between runs as the relaxation process may lead to slightly different conformations, affecting the calculated binding energy and altering candidate rankings.\n\n### 3. How will you change the AlphaFold-Multimer component of the workflow (if at all) to improve ipLDDT score consistency while still only using one AlphaFold-Multimer run (five models)?\n\n**Proposed Change:**\n- **Averaging Across Models:** Instead of selecting the top-ranked model based solely on ipLDDT, average the ipLDDT scores from all five generated models in a single run. This approach accounts for variability by integrating confidence scores across multiple predictions, enhancing robustness without increasing computational cost.\n\n### 4. In your new workflow, what AlphaFold-Multimer complex structure will you use as input to Rosetta?\n\n**Selection of Structure:**\n- Use the structure with the median ipLDDT score from the five models. This strategy mitigates the impact of outliers (very high or very low scores) and provides a more stable and representative model for subsequent Rosetta analysis.\n\n### 5. How will you change the Rosetta component of the workflow (if at all) to improve dG_separated score consistency while still only using one Rosetta run on one complex structure?\n\n**Proposed Change:**\n- **Multiple Relaxation Trials with Averaging:** Within a single Rosetta run, perform multiple relaxation trials (e.g., three) using the same input structure and average the resulting dG_separated scores. This method reduces variability by smoothing out fluctuations through repeated assessments of the same structure.\n\n**Overall Strategy:**\nBy averaging scores across generated models and multiple relaxation trials, we aim to enhance the stability and consistency of the ipLDDT and dG_separated scores. This approach maintains computational efficiency and improves the reliability of nanobody rankings, leading to more confident selections for experimental validation."
