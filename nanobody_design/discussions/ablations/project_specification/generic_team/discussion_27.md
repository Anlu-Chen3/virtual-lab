## Assistant Lead

Certainly, team. As the Assistant Lead, I’d like to kick off this meeting by emphasizing the importance of our research project in the context of the ongoing efforts to combat SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Our goal is to develop effective antibodies or nanobodies that can target the newest variant of the spike protein, as well as provide some breadth of protection against other variants.

Here are my initial thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: Nanobodies are smaller and can be more stable than conventional antibodies, potentially allowing better access to hidden epitopes on the spike protein. However, antibodies have a more established framework for therapeutic use. We need to weigh the pros and cons of each.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Molecules**: Designing de novo can provide novel solutions, but modifying existing antibodies or nanobodies might speed up the process and leverage previous research. We should consider the current landscape of existing antibodies or nanobodies known to target coronavirus spike proteins.

3. **Selection of Candidates for Modification**: If we choose to modify existing molecules, selecting the right starting candidates is crucial. We should consider the binding affinity, stability, and previous efficacy against similar variants.

4. **Approach for De Novo Design**: Should we go this route, we need a robust strategy involving computational tools and machine learning models to quickly generate and screen potential candidates.

To guide our discussion, here are some questions I have for the team:

- What are your thoughts on the advantages and limitations of nanobodies compared to traditional antibodies, especially in the context of SARS-CoV-2?
- Do you believe our current computational tools are advanced enough to support a de novo design process effectively?
- Are there specific existing antibodies or nanobodies you believe have shown promise against previous variants that could be good candidates for modification?
- How can we ensure our design approach prioritizes cross-variant efficacy to maximize the impact of our final product?

I’m eager to hear each of your insights on these points. We’ll go through each team member’s perspective, and then I’ll synthesize our discussion to make informed decisions. Let’s begin with Assistant 1's thoughts.

## User

Assistant 1, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 1

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Nanobodies vs. Antibodies**: I lean towards developing nanobodies due to their smaller size, which allows them to bind to less accessible regions on the spike protein. Their robustness and ease of production in microbial systems are also significant advantages, potentially leading to faster development and lower costs.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modification**: I advocate for modifying existing nanobodies. This approach allows us to leverage the wealth of existing research and data on nanobodies that have already shown efficacy against similar coronaviruses, potentially expediting our development timeline.

3. **Candidates for Modification**: For modification, I suggest looking into nanobodies like Ty1, which has shown efficacy against earlier variants, and nanobodies from the VHH-72 and H11-D4 families that have been noted for their strong binding to the spike protein.

4. **Cross-Variant Efficacy**: By focusing on existing nanobodies with broad neutralizing activity, we can start with a solid foundation and enhance their breadth through strategic modifications. This might involve using machine learning to predict mutations in the spike protein and preemptively design nanobodies that maintain binding across these changes.

As a team, we should consider the current capabilities of our machine learning models and computational power when proposing modifications. This approach blends our strengths in computational biology with the existing body of nanobody research, potentially providing a versatile and effective therapeutic. 

I'm eager to hear what Assistant 2 thinks, particularly if there are additional nanobody candidates or alternative strategies we should consider.

Assistant 2, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 2

Thank you, Assistant 1, for your insights. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Nanobodies vs. Antibodies**: I agree with the preference for nanobodies due to their smaller size and stability, which make them suitable for targeting difficult-to-access epitopes on the spike protein. Their potential for cost-effective production is another advantage that we should not overlook.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modification**: While I understand the appeal of modifying existing nanobodies for expediency and leveraging past successes, I would like to advocate for a de novo design approach. Our computational capabilities and machine learning algorithms have advanced significantly, and we can use these tools to generate innovative candidates that might exhibit superior binding and cross-variant efficacy.

3. **Approach for De Novo Design**: For de novo design, I propose employing a combination of in silico techniques such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning models to predict and optimize nanobody interactions with various spike protein conformations. We can then validate these candidates through high-throughput screening in vitro.

4. **Ensuring Cross-Variant Efficacy**: By designing de novo, we can specifically target conserved regions on the spike protein that are less prone to mutation, thereby enhancing cross-variant efficacy from the start. Our machine learning models can help identify these regions and suggest optimal binding motifs.

While modifying existing nanobodies is a viable approach, I believe a de novo strategy could provide us with novel and potentially more potent solutions that are specifically tailored to the newest variant and other circulating strains. I'm curious to hear from Assistant 3 about whether they see any other potential candidates or strategies to consider.

Additionally, their ability to penetrate and bind to hidden epitopes is crucial for dealing with the spike protein's mutational landscape.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modification**: I see merit in both approaches. However, I lean towards modifying existing nanobodies. The availability of potent candidates like Ty1 and VHH-72 provides a strong starting point. This approach could expedite development and allow us to focus our computational resources on optimizing these existing frameworks for broader efficacy.

3. **Candidates for Modification**: I agree with Assistant 1’s selection of Ty1 and VHH-72. Additionally, I suggest considering nanobodies identified in recent studies focused on broad neutralization. These studies might uncover candidates with inherent cross-variant activities that we can further enhance.

4. **Machine Learning Integration**: Regardless of the approach, integrating machine learning is critical. For modification, these tools can predict interactions and necessary adjustments to enhance binding and cross-reactivity. Ensuring our models are updated with the latest variant data will be essential to our success.

While de novo design is undoubtedly exciting, modifying proven nanobodies could offer a balanced approach between innovation and practicality. I'm interested to hear Assistant 4's perspective, especially considering any recent studies or technologies that might have gone under the radar.

   - **Justification**: Modifying existing nanobodies expedites the development process by building on proven frameworks, allowing us to focus computational resources on optimization and enhancement for broader efficacy.

3. **If modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies, which precise antibodies/nanobodies will you modify (please list 3-4)?**
   - **Answer**: Ty1, VHH-72, H11-D4.
   - **Justification**: These nanobodies have demonstrated binding efficacy against previous variants and serve as reliable starting points for further modification and optimization.

4. **If designing antibodies/nanobodies de novo, how exactly will you propose antibody/nanobody candidates?**
   - **Answer**: Not applicable.
   - **Justification**: The decision to modify existing nanobodies makes this question irrelevant for our current strategy.
