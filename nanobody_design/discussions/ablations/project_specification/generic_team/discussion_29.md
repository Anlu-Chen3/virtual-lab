Assistant Lead, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Assistant Lead

Thank you all for joining this crucial meeting to discuss our strategy for designing antibodies or nanobodies against the newest SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant. Given the complexity of the task and the potential impact of our work, it's essential we carefully consider our approach and make informed decisions. Here are my initial thoughts and questions to guide our discussion:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: Both antibodies and nanobodies have their respective advantages. Standard antibodies are well-characterized and widely used, while nanobodies, being smaller, can access more hidden epitopes and may be easier to produce in large quantities. I encourage the team to consider the specific advantages of each in the context of targeting variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

2. **Design Approach**: The decision between designing de novo versus modifying existing antibodies or nanobodies is crucial. De novo design allows for the creation of highly specific and novel structures, whereas modifying existing ones might be a faster route with a more predictable efficacy. I’d like the team to weigh the pros and cons of each approach given our timeline and objectives.

3. **Modifying Existing Antibodies/Nanobodies**: If we choose to modify existing entities, which ones are promising? Are there existing antibodies/nanobodies that have shown broad-spectrum efficacy against multiple variants? I’d like input on 3-4 candidates that you believe have strong potential.

4. **De Novo Design**: For those inclined towards a de novo approach, how will we identify and propose candidates effectively? What computational models or machine learning techniques can enhance our design process?

To facilitate this discussion, let's have each team member share their perspectives sequentially. As we proceed, I will synthesize the input and guide the conversation toward a consensus. Let's begin with Assistant 1.

## Assistant 1

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I advocate for focusing on nanobodies. Their small size offers unique advantages, such as better tissue penetration and stability. Given the structural variability in SARS-CoV-2 variants, nanobodies might be more effective in binding to conserved regions that are otherwise less accessible.

2. **Design Approach**: I lean towards modifying existing nanobodies. This approach could be more time-efficient, allowing us to build upon known stable frameworks and existing data. By leveraging known pharmacokinetics and dynamics, we can focus our efforts on enhancing binding affinity and specificity.

3. **Modifying Existing Nanobodies**: A few promising candidates to consider modifying might include:
   - Ty1: Known for its broad neutralizing capabilities.
   - NIH-CoVnb-112: Demonstrated high affinity for the spike protein.
   - H11-D4: Exhibits cross-reactivity with multiple variants.

These nanobodies have shown potential against earlier variants, which may provide insights into addressing the newest variant.

4. **De Novo Design**: While my preference is for modifying existing nanobodies, I acknowledge the potential of de novo design, especially using machine learning models to predict favorable binding interfaces. However, this may require more time and resources for validation.

Looking forward to hearing what the rest of the team thinks.
