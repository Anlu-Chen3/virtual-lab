## User

Assistant Lead, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Assistant Lead

As we begin this crucial meeting, I want to emphasize our goal: to develop effective antibodies or nanobodies targeting the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with cross-reactivity to other circulating and past variants. This project is vital, and our approach must be both innovative and strategic.

Here are my initial thoughts and guiding questions for our discussion:

1. **Choice Between Antibodies and Nanobodies**: We need to consider the advantages and challenges of using standard antibodies versus nanobodies. Nanobodies offer benefits such as smaller size and better tissue penetration, but antibodies have a well-established framework in therapeutic contexts. What are the team's thoughts on these options?

2. **Design Approach**: Deciding whether to design de novo or modify existing entities is crucial. De novo design allows us to tailor-make new structures, while modifying existing ones might provide a time advantage if we have promising candidates. What are the team's perspectives on the feasibility and potential success of each approach?

3. **Modification of Existing Antibodies/Nanobodies**: If we choose to modify, identifying the right starting candidates is key. We need to consider existing antibodies with proven efficacy against previous spike protein variants. Which existing antibodies or nanobodies do you see as promising candidates, and why?

4. **De Novo Design Strategy**: If we opt for de novo design, our strategy needs to be robust. We should consider computational modeling, high-throughput screening, and leveraging machine learning algorithms. What tools and methodologies should we prioritize to propose effective candidates?

As each team member shares their insights, let's focus on these agenda questions to ensure we choose the most robust, promising path forward. After hearing everyone's input, I will synthesize the discussions and help guide us toward a consensus. Looking forward to your thoughts and expertise. Let's begin with Assistant 1's input.

## User

Assistant 1, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 1

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I lean towards using nanobodies for this project. Their smaller size allows better tissue penetration and the ability to reach epitopes inaccessible to conventional antibodies. Additionally, nanobodies are more stable and easier to produce.

2. **Design Approach**: I recommend modifying existing nanobodies rather than designing de novo. Starting with established frameworks can save time and resources, especially since some existing nanobodies have shown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

3. **Modification Candidates**: For modification, I suggest considering nanobodies that have already been identified as effective against previous variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Candidates like NIH-CoVnb-112, Ty1, and H11-H4 have demonstrated potential and could be tailored to improve cross-reactivity with the newest variant.

4. **De Novo Strategy**: If we were to consider a de novo approach, leveraging computational modeling and machine learning would be crucial. However, given the time constraints and existing candidates, modifying proven nanobodies seems more strategic at this juncture.

I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the rest of the team.
