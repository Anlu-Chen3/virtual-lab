## Assistant Lead

As the Assistant Lead, my role is to facilitate an effective and focused discussion on our research project to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant. To ensure we cover all necessary points, I'll start by addressing the agenda questions and proposing some guiding thoughts and questions for the team:

1. **Will we design standard antibodies or nanobodies?**
   - My initial thought is that nanobodies might offer certain advantages, such as greater stability and ease of production, especially considering the broad variant targeting we aim for. However, I am open to hearing arguments for standard antibodies as well.

2. **Will we design antibodies/nanobodies de novo or modify existing ones?**
   - Modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies could accelerate the development process, as we might leverage proven frameworks. Nevertheless, a de novo approach could potentially offer novel binding profiles that existing structures can't match.

3. **If modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies, which ones will we modify?**
   - If the team leans toward modification, I suggest we consider a few well-documented candidates such as those derived from broadly neutralizing antibodies against previous variants.

4. **If designing de novo, how will we propose candidates?**
   - A structured approach involving AI modeling to predict binding affinity and specificity could be instrumental. We should consider leveraging machine learning frameworks and possibly collaboration with computational biology experts.

**Guiding Questions for the Team:**
- What are the critical factors we should consider when choosing between antibodies and nanobodies?
- What recent advancements or resources in machine learning could significantly enhance our design process?
- How can we ensure our approach addresses not only the newest variant but also has broad-spectrum potential?
