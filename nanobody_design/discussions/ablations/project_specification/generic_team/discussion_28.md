2. **Design Approach - De Novo vs. Modification**:
   - Designing de novo offers the flexibility to tailor-make solutions specific to the current variant, but is resource and time-intensive. Modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies could leverage already proven structures, reducing developmental time.
   - **Question**: Considering our available resources, time constraints, and the urgency of addressing SARS-CoV-2 variants, what are the key factors that should drive our decision to choose between de novo design and modification of existing molecules?

3. **Selection of Existing Candidates**:
   - If the modification route is chosen, selecting the right starting candidates is crucial for success. 
   - **Question**: Which existing antibodies or nanobodies are known to have broad-spectrum activity against coronaviruses, and what makes them good candidates for modification against the new variant?

4. **Proposing De Novo Candidates**:
   - If we choose to pursue de novo design, we will need a robust methodology for candidate proposal.
   - **Question**: What machine learning models and datasets are best suited for predicting and designing effective de novo antibody or nanobody candidates targeting the spike protein?

After these introductory insights and questions, I look forward to hearing from each team member in order. Let’s delve into these issues so that we can move forward with a clear and focused strategy.

   - **Justification**: Their smaller size and unique properties make them more suitable for rapid adaptation and production, along with broad-spectrum potential.

2. **Will you design antibodies/nanobodies de novo or will you modify existing antibodies/nanobodies?**
   - **Answer**: Modify existing nanobodies
   - **Justification**: Modifying existing nanobodies offers a quicker turnaround while allowing us to leverage established structures with known efficacy.

3. **If modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies, which precise antibodies/nanobodies will you modify?**
   - **Answer**: Ty1, VHH-72, Nb21, Nb6
   - **Justification**: These nanobodies have demonstrated broad neutralizing capabilities against previous variants and provide a strong foundation for modification.

4. **If designing antibodies/nanobodies de novo, how exactly will you propose antibody/nanobody candidates?**
   - **Answer**: Set up a parallel track to explore de novo design using machine learning models like GANs and reinforcement learning.
   - **Justification**: While modification is prioritized, exploring de novo design could uncover novel solutions that are highly optimized for the current variant.
