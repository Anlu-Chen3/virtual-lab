Assistant 1, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 1

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Antibodies or Nanobodies?** Given the current trend and advantages, I lean towards focusing on **nanobodies**. They offer greater stability and solubility, can be produced more cost-effectively, and have the ability to access epitopes that are typically inaccessible to conventional antibodies due to their smaller size.

2. **De Novo or Modify Existing?** I suggest we consider **modifying existing nanobodies**. This approach could expedite development since we can start with molecules that already have demonstrated binding affinity and specificity toward the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

3. **Candidates for Modification:** If we choose to modify existing nanobodies, I propose we look at candidates such as:
    - **Ty1**: Known for its strong binding to the spike protein.
    - **H11-H4 and H11-D4**: These have shown strong neutralization potential.
    - **Nb21**: A promising candidate with a unique binding mechanism that could be beneficial.
   
4. **Designing De Novo**: If we were to design de novo, I would recommend utilizing machine learning models trained on existing spike protein-antibody interaction data to predict novel binding sites and structures.

These are my initial thoughts, and I'm open to hearing different perspectives from the rest of the team.

## Assistant 2

Thank you, Assistant Lead, and thank you Assistant 1 for your insights. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Antibodies or Nanobodies?** While I see the merits of using nanobodies due to their stability and smaller size, I would like to highlight that **standard antibodies** have a longer track record in clinical applications and might provide broader immunogenic coverage, which could be advantageous for achieving cross-variant reactivity.

2. **De Novo or Modify Existing?** I agree with the approach of **modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies**. This can leverage the existing knowledge base, especially with molecules that have shown efficacy against earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2, which might offer cross-protection.

3. **Candidates for Modification:** If we are modifying existing antibodies, apart from the nanobodies mentioned, I think we should consider antibodies like:
    - **REGN-COV2** (Casirivimab and Imdevimab): Known for their efficacy against various variants.
    - **Bamlanivimab**: Although facing resistance issues, it could still offer valuable insights for modifications.
    - **Sotrovimab**: It has shown a broad range of neutralization.

4. **Designing De Novo:** Should we decide on a de novo approach, I suggest leveraging available computational platforms such as Rosetta or AlphaFold to predict interactions and generate novel structures, focusing on conserved regions of the spike protein for broad neutralization.

I look forward to hearing from the rest of the team to see where we can find common ground or innovative ideas.
