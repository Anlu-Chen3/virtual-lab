## User

Assistant Lead, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Assistant Lead

Thank you for joining the meeting, everyone. Our agenda today is to strategize on developing antibodies or nanobodies that can effectively target the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, while also having potential efficacy against other circulating and past variants. This is a significant task, and I appreciate everyone’s input on this.

Here are my initial thoughts and questions to guide our discussion:

1. **Choice between Antibodies and Nanobodies**: The decision between using standard antibodies or nanobodies is crucial. Nanobodies, known for their smaller size and higher stability, could offer unique advantages, particularly in terms of penetrability and stability. However, standard antibodies might offer broader applicability and established methodologies. What are your thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages of each option, given our specific target?

2. **De novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Structures**: Designing de novo could open up innovative solutions but requires more time and computational resources. On the other hand, modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies could leverage known effective structures and potentially expedite development. Which approach seems more feasible and promising to you, considering our project timeline and objectives?

3. **Selection of Existing Antibodies/Nanobodies for Modification**: If we choose to modify existing structures, we need to identify candidate antibodies/nanobodies that show promising activity against similar variants. Please share any candidates you are aware of that have shown efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, especially those with cross-variant activity.

4. **De novo Design Strategies**: If we opt for de novo design, we need a robust strategy to propose effective candidates. What machine learning approaches or computational methods do you suggest we employ to accurately predict and design these structures?

Let's start with Assistant 1, and each of you will have the opportunity to share your insights. Once everyone has contributed, I will summarize the points raised, synthesize our discussion, and we’ll continue with follow-up questions as needed. Thank you, and Assistant 1, please share your thoughts.

Assistant 1, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 1

Thank you for inviting me to share my thoughts. Here’s my perspective on the agenda:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I lean towards using nanobodies due to their smaller size and higher stability, which can be particularly advantageous when targeting diverse and evolving viral structures like the spike protein. Their ability to bind with high affinity and specificity, even to hidden epitopes, can be a significant advantage in our research.

2. **De novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Structures**: I believe modifying existing nanobodies might be more efficient for our project timeline. We can build on the wealth of data we already have for existing candidates, potentially enabling quicker iterative improvements. This approach may also increase the likelihood of success by refining already effective structures.

3. **Candidate Selection for Modification**: In terms of existing candidates, I suggest starting with nanobodies like Nb21, Ty1, and H11-H4. These have shown promising results in binding to previous SARS-CoV-2 variants and might serve as strong starting points for further enhancement.

4. **De novo Design Strategies**: If we opt for de novo design, utilizing machine learning models like AlphaFold for protein structure prediction could be invaluable. Additionally, incorporating reinforcement learning could assist in optimizing interactions with the spike protein.

These are my initial thoughts, and I’m open to hearing other perspectives. Thank you.

Assistant 2, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 2

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I agree with Assistant 1 on the potential benefits of using nanobodies, particularly given their stability and ability to effectively target compact or hidden epitopes. However, we should also consider the potential limitations in terms of scalability and production compared to standard antibodies.

2. **De novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Structures**: While modifying existing nanobodies could indeed expedite the process, I am inclined towards considering a parallel approach where we also explore de novo design. This way, we can benefit from the strengths of both approaches: the speed and reliability of modifications, and the potential novelty and increased specificity from de novo designs.

3. **Candidate Selection for Modification**: I support the idea of considering nanobodies like Nb21 and Ty1, as they have shown promise in previous studies. Additionally, we could look into other candidates from recent studies that have shown broad-spectrum activity to ensure we’re not missing out on newer developments.

4. **De novo Design Strategies**: In terms of de novo design, leveraging generative deep learning models to create novel structures could be a game-changer. These models can provide insights into potential candidates that we might not consider through traditional methods alone.

I believe a hybrid approach could maximize our chances of developing effective solutions efficiently. Thank you.

This approach allows us to utilize existing data on proven candidates, potentially speeding up our timeline. However, I agree with Assistant 2’s suggestion of considering a parallel track for de novo design. This dual approach could provide us with a broader pool of candidates and cover more ground in terms of innovation.

3. **Candidate Selection for Modification**: Starting with nanobodies like Nb21, Ty1, and H11-H4 is a sound approach. Additionally, I suggest including VHH72, which has demonstrated cross-reactivity with different coronavirus variants, in our list for potential modifications.

4. **De novo Design Strategies**: For de novo designs, I strongly recommend integrating AI-driven tools such as those using generative adversarial networks (GANs) alongside structure prediction models. This could enhance our ability to explore novel structures that might outperform existing ones.

In summary, a balanced approach that incorporates both existing modifications and exploratory de novo designs could be very beneficial. I look forward to hearing other views. Thank you.

Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts. Here's my input:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I agree with the preference for nanobodies due to their distinct advantages in targeting viral structures and their potential for cost-effective production. However, I think we should keep an open mind about antibodies for specific applications where their larger binding surface could be beneficial.

2. **De novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Structures**: While modifying existing nanobodies seems efficient, I would like to emphasize the potential of de novo design, especially using advanced machine learning algorithms that can explore a wide array of novel candidates. This could lead to breakthroughs beyond the current limitations of existing structures.

3. **Candidate Selection for Modification**: I support the suggested candidates like Nb21 and Ty1, but I also propose considering newer candidates from recent publications, particularly those that have been shown to maintain efficacy against a range of variants. Staying updated with the latest research could uncover additional promising options.

4. **De novo Design Strategies**: For de novo design, I suggest using a combination of computational approaches, such as reinforcement learning models tailored for optimizing binding affinity and specificity. This could be complemented by high-throughput screening in silico to prioritize the most promising designs for further development.

Overall, I believe a comprehensive approach that includes both modifying existing candidates and exploring de novo designs could be most effective. Thank you.

Assistant 1, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 1

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the follow-up questions:

1. **Balancing Resources Between Approaches**: To balance resources effectively, I suggest allocating a larger portion of resources to modifying existing nanobodies initially, given the likelihood of quicker results. Simultaneously, we can dedicate a smaller, focused team to start the groundwork on de novo design. As we gather more data and insights from modifications, we can adjust resource allocation accordingly.

2. **AI Models for De novo Design**: I have experience with AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, which I believe would be a cornerstone in our de novo design strategy. Additionally, using reinforcement learning frameworks like DeepMind’s AlphaGo approach could be adapted for optimizing binding interactions.
