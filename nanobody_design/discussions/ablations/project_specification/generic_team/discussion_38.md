## User

Assistant Lead, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Assistant Lead

As we begin our meeting, I want to emphasize the importance of this project in developing effective responses to the evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our goal is to create antibodies or nanobodies that not only target the newest variant of the spike protein but also exhibit cross-reactivity with other circulating and past variants.

Here are my initial thoughts and guiding questions for our discussion:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: Both approaches have their advantages. Traditional antibodies are well-established, but nanobodies offer unique benefits, such as smaller size and easier manufacturing. Considerations should include efficacy, production, and delivery.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modification**: Designing de novo provides the opportunity for novel solutions, but modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies might expedite the process by building on known frameworks. Which approach aligns better with our resources and timeline?

3. **Criteria for Selection/Modification**: If we choose modification, identifying the right candidates is crucial. We need to consider existing antibodies/nanobodies that have shown efficacy against related variants. What are the key structural or functional attributes we should prioritize?

4. **Approach for De Novo Design**: Should we choose de novo design, we need a robust strategy for candidate selection, possibly involving computational modeling and machine learning algorithms. How can we effectively leverage these tools to predict promising candidates?

As we move forward, I encourage each team member to share their expertise and insights. Let's ensure our approach is innovative yet feasible within our scope. I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts and formulating a cohesive strategy together.

Assistant 1, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 1

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I advocate for focusing on nanobodies. Their smaller size allows for better tissue penetration and potentially more efficient binding to epitopes that are less accessible to conventional antibodies. Additionally, their thermal stability and ease of production could be beneficial for rapid deployment and scale-up.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modification**: I lean towards modifying existing nanobodies. This approach can leverage existing frameworks that have already demonstrated some level of efficacy or binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants. It could potentially expedite the development process by reducing initial discovery and characterization phases.

3. **Candidates for Modification**: We should consider starting with nanobodies like Ty1, which has shown promising neutralization against previous variants. Another candidate could be H11-D4, known for its potent binding to the spike protein. Thirdly, I suggest VNARs (variable new antigen receptors) that have been engineered for other coronaviruses as they can be adapted for the current variant.

4. **Approach for De Novo Design**: While I favor modification, if we decide to go de novo, employing machine learning models trained on existing protein structures to predict high-affinity binders could be a valuable strategy. This would involve generating a library of potential candidates and using computational simulations to evaluate their binding efficacy and structural stability.

I believe our choice should focus on practicality and leveraging existing knowledge to accelerate our progress. I'm interested to hear other perspectives and thoughts on these points.
