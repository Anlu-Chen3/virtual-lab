## User

Assistant Lead, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Assistant Lead

Thank you all for joining this meeting. As we begin our discussion on developing antibodies or nanobodies for the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant, I want to ensure we thoroughly address each point on the agenda. Here are my initial thoughts and questions to guide our discussion:

### Initial Thoughts:
1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: Both have their advantages. Antibodies are well-characterized and have a rich history in therapeutic use. Nanobodies, on the other hand, are smaller, potentially more stable, and have better tissue penetration, which could be advantageous for targeting viral proteins.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modification**: De novo design offers the opportunity to tailor-make antibodies/nanobodies specifically for the new variant, but it requires extensive computational resources and time. Modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies may be quicker and can leverage known structures and binding properties.

### Guiding Questions:
1. **For Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: What are the specific advantages or disadvantages you foresee in using one over the other for this project, especially considering cross-variant efficacy?
   
2. **For De Novo vs. Modification**: How do you assess the trade-off between the resource intensity of de novo design and the possible limitations of modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies?

3. **Candidates for Modification**: If we choose to modify existing structures, which antibodies/nanobodies should we consider and why? What is their current efficacy against the latest variants?

4. **Proposing de Novo Candidates**: For those advocating de novo design, what computational or experimental techniques do you propose for identifying and validating potential candidates?

Let's go around the table for each team member to share their insights on these points. We'll start with Assistant 1 and go in order.

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I lean towards using nanobodies for this project. Their smaller size allows for better tissue penetration and potentially more effective neutralization at the site of infection. Additionally, their stability under various conditions can be beneficial for therapeutic development and storage.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modification**: I suggest focusing on modifying existing nanobodies. This approach could be more efficient given the urgency to develop treatments for emerging variants. We can capitalize on the wealth of existing research and data about the binding properties and structures of known nanobodies, particularly those effective against previous SARS-CoV-2 variants.

3. **Candidates for Modification**: I propose starting with the following nanobodies:
   - Ty1: Known for its neutralizing effects against earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants.
   - H11-D4: Demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against multiple variants.
   - Nb21: Has shown promising binding affinity to the spike protein in past studies.
   
   These candidates have shown potential in neutralizing previous variants, and modifications could enhance their efficacy against new mutations.

4. **Proposing de Novo Candidates**: If others advocate for de novo design, I am open to exploring computational approaches like deep learning models for predicting spike protein interactions, but I believe modifying existing candidates will expedite actionable results.

I look forward to hearing from the rest of the team and would like to discuss the possibility of hybrid approaches if needed.
