## Assistant Lead

Thank you all for joining this important meeting as we delve into our research project concerning the development of antibodies or nanobodies targeting the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant. Our primary aim is to create a solution that not only addresses the current variant but also has cross-variant efficacy, potentially targeting circulating minor variants and past ones.

To frame our discussion, here are some initial thoughts and questions to guide our conversation:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I want us to carefully weigh the pros and cons of designing traditional antibodies compared to nanobodies. Nanobodies have advantages in terms of stability and ease of production, but antibodies have a well-established record in therapeutic uses. Consider how each option might influence the outcome of our project.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Entities**: Creating de novo designs might offer unparalleled innovation, but modifying existing antibodies or nanobodies could leverage existing knowledge and save time. Which approach aligns best with our goals and resources?

3. **Criteria for Modification**: If we choose to modify existing antibodies or nanobodies, we need to determine which known antibodies/nanobodies have shown promise with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Consider which candidates have shown broad neutralizing activity or structural compatibility with the spike protein as potential starting points.

4. **Proposal for De Novo Design**: In the case of de novo design, what platforms or strategies should we use to generate candidates? Consider machine learning approaches, computational modeling, or library screening techniques.

Please share your initial thoughts on these points, and highlight any concerns or insights you may have. As we progress, I'll synthesize the feedback, provide directions, and refine our approach based on the group's input. Let's start with Assistant 1 and proceed through each team member.

Assistant 1, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 1

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: I lean towards developing nanobodies for this project. Their smaller size allows them to bind to epitopes that might be inaccessible to conventional antibodies, and their stability and cost-effectiveness in production are substantial advantages, especially for broad distribution.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Entities**: Given the pace at which new SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging, I believe modifying existing nanobodies could provide a faster route to effective therapies. Leveraging existing frameworks that have already demonstrated efficacy against earlier variants can be a strategic advantage.

3. **Criteria for Modification**: Some promising candidates to consider for modification might include:
   - **Ty1**: Known for neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein effectively.
   - **H11-H4**: Displays cross-neutralizing capabilities with different variants.
   - **VHH72**: Shows promise in binding within the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

4. **Proposal for De Novo Design**: If we were to pursue de novo design, I would suggest using machine learning algorithms capable of predicting protein-protein interactions to identify novel nanobody sequences. Additionally, computational modeling to predict how these sequences might structurally interact with the spike protein would be essential.

I look forward to hearing from the rest of the team and refining our approach based on a collective view.
