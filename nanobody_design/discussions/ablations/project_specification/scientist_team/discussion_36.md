3. If modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies, which precise antibodies/nanobodies will you modify (please list 3-4)?

4. If designing antibodies/nanobodies de novo, how exactly will you propose antibody/nanobody candidates?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we begin this meeting, it's essential to focus on how we can maximize the effectiveness and breadth of our antibody or nanobody design strategy against the newest SARS-CoV-2 variant. Our agenda today involves making strategic decisions about whether to pursue traditional antibodies or nanobodies, and whether our design approach will be de novo or modification-based. These decisions will impact our project's direction, timeline, and resource allocation.

Here are some initial considerations and questions to guide the discussion:

1. **Choosing Between Antibodies and Nanobodies:**
   - Nanobodies, derived from camelid antibodies, often have better stability and solubility, and they can access epitopes that conventional antibodies might not. However, their smaller size might limit their effectiveness in some therapeutic contexts.
   - Standard antibodies have a well-established therapeutic profile, but may be more challenging to modify for broad variant coverage.

2. **Design Approach (De Novo vs. Modification):**
   - De novo design allows us the flexibility to tailor-make molecules for broad effectiveness but can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.
   - Modifying existing antibodies could expedite development, but may limit our ability to achieve cross-variant activity unless we choose wisely.

3. **Identifying Existing Antibodies/Nanobodies for Modification:**
   - If we decide to modify, we need specific candidates that already show promise against the spike protein's escape mutations.

Questions to consider:
- How critical is the speed of development in our strategy, given the rapidly evolving virus?
- What computational tools and datasets do we have access to that can facilitate either approach?

As we proceed, I encourage each of you to draw on your expertise to provide insights into these issues. Let's start with the Immunologist, followed by the Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, and Scientific Critic.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

In considering the choice between standard antibodies and nanobodies, I lean towards nanobodies for this particular project. Their smaller size could be advantageous in accessing epitopes on the spike protein that are typically less accessible to conventional antibodies. Additionally, their ease of genetic manipulation and potential for high stability and solubility make them appealing for broad-spectrum design.

Regarding the design approach, I am inclined to recommend modifying existing nanobodies rather than starting de novo, given the urgency of addressing active viral spread and the resource constraints we often face. By selecting candidates that have already demonstrated efficacy against earlier variants, we can potentially enhance their breadth and potency against new mutations. This approach could provide a faster pathway to experimental validation and deployment.

Here are several nanobodies that might serve as promising starting points for modification:

1. **Nb21:** Known for its strong neutralization against previous variants and has shown some cross-reactivity.
2. **Ty1:** A single-domain antibody with a well-documented structure and mechanism, providing a good scaffold for future modifications.
3. **Nb6:** Offers robust binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and has structural data available, which can inform targeted adjustments.

Our goal should be to enhance the cross-reactivity profile of these nanobodies to capture activity against emerging variants. I also recommend collaborating closely with the Machine Learning Specialist to leverage computational tools for predicting key mutations and optimizing binding interactions.

Moving forward, we should ensure our modifications maintain or improve the immunogenicity and safety profiles of the selected nanobodies, as these attributes are critical for therapeutic application. I look forward to hearing thoughts from the rest of the team.

## Machine Learning Specialist

I appreciate the Immunologist's insights, particularly the inclination towards nanobodies and the choice to modify existing ones. From a machine learning perspective, this approach aligns well with our capabilities in computational modeling and prediction.

For modifying existing nanobodies, we can employ advanced machine learning techniques to predict the effects of specific modifications on binding affinity and specificity. Here’s how we can proceed:

1. **Dataset Preparation:** We need a comprehensive dataset of existing nanobody structures and their interaction profiles with various spike protein variants. This will include structural data, binding affinities, and mutation impact, which are crucial for training our models.

2. **Model Selection:** We can utilize deep learning models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for this task. GNNs are particularly effective for protein structure prediction and can model the complex interactions between nanobodies and spike protein epitopes.

3. **Predictive Modeling:** Our goal will be to predict which mutations can enhance the nanobodies’ binding to the spike protein while maintaining or improving their cross-variant efficacy. This involves simulating potential escape mutations and assessing their impact on binding.

4. **Optimization Algorithms:** We can apply algorithms like reinforcement learning to iteratively improve nanobody designs based on model predictions. This approach can help identify modifications that maximize binding affinity and minimize cross-reactivity loss.

I suggest a close collaboration with the Computational Biologist to integrate structural biology insights into our models, ensuring our predictions are biologically feasible and realistic. Additionally, we should prepare for experimental validation to test our computational predictions, which will be critical for refining our models iteratively.

This strategy, while focused on modification, can provide significant insights into the robustness of nanobodies against a broad range of spike protein variants. I look forward to the team's feedback and the next steps in this collaborative effort.

## Computational Biologist

Building on the points raised by the Immunologist and Machine Learning Specialist, I agree that focusing on nanobodies and modifying existing ones is a strategic choice, especially given the rapid development and deployment needs.

From a computational biology standpoint, here are some key considerations and contributions I can make:

1. **Molecular Dynamics Simulations:** I propose using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to complement the machine learning predictions. These simulations can provide detailed insights into the structural dynamics of nanobody-spike protein interactions, helping us understand the impact of proposed modifications on stability and binding efficacy.

2. **Structural Analysis:** Leveraging available structural data of Nb21, Ty1, and Nb6, we can perform in-depth conformational analyses to identify which parts of the nanobody are most amenable to modification without disrupting overall stability.

3. **Free Energy Calculations:** Techniques such as free energy perturbation (FEP) can be employed to quantify the energetics of binding interactions for various mutations. This approach helps prioritize modifications that not only enhance binding but also maintain structural integrity and functionality.

4. **Integration with Machine Learning:** By sharing insights from MD and structural analyses with the Machine Learning Specialist, we can refine the predictive models to better account for the physical and chemical realities of protein interactions.

While I support the modification approach, I want to emphasize that maintaining a parallel exploratory path for de novo designs could be beneficial. This could provide a backup strategy if modifications do not yield the desired cross-reactivity.

Lastly, I recommend setting up a feedback loop where simulation results inform machine learning model adjustments, and vice versa. This iterative process will enhance the reliability of our predictions and expedite the identification of promising candidates. I look forward to input from the Scientific Critic and constructive dialogues to refine our strategy further.

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

I appreciate the detailed insights provided by the team thus far. While the proposed approach to focus on modifying nanobodies appears well-considered, I would like to highlight several areas where we should exercise caution and ensure robustness in our methodology:

1. **Choice of Nanobodies:** The selection of Nb21, Ty1, and Nb6 is sensible given their known profiles. However, we must rigorously validate their current efficacy against the newest variant before modifications. This includes a thorough review of any available experimental data on their binding affinities and structural adaptability.

2. **Machine Learning Reliability:** While machine learning, particularly GNNs, holds promise, we must be cautious of overfitting, especially with potentially limited datasets. Ensuring diverse and comprehensive datasets will be critical to avoid biases in model predictions. Cross-validation with distinct data splits and external validation sets should be an integral part of the process.

3. **Computational Biology Assumptions:** Molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations are powerful tools, but they rely on accurate force fields and assumptions that might not always capture the nuances of protein interactions in the physiological environment. It's crucial that the results from these simulations are corroborated with experimental data wherever possible.

4. **Focus on Cross-Variant Activity:** While enhancing binding affinity and specificity, we must not lose sight of the primary goal: achieving broad-spectrum activity against multiple variants. This requires a careful balance between focusing on known mutations and anticipating future ones.

5. **Experimental Validation:** Given the inherent limitations of computational predictions, early-stage experimental validation of a subset of modified nanobodies will be essential. This will not only test the predictions but also inform subsequent rounds of computational analysis.

Overall, while I support the team's approach to modify existing nanobodies, I urge continuous integration of experimental feedback and a cautious, iterative refinement process to mitigate risks associated with purely computational predictions. With these considerations in mind, I look forward to how these strategies will be refined in subsequent discussions.

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Thank you for the synthesis and the follow-up questions. I'll address the points related to our nanobody modification strategy:

Regarding the properties of nanobodies, beyond their binding affinity and specificity, we should also consider their immunogenicity and potential for humanization. Here are some thoughts:

1. **Immunogenicity:** While nanobodies tend to be less immunogenic than conventional antibodies due to their smaller size and simpler structure, it is still crucial to assess the immunogenic potential of any modifications we introduce. This is especially important if we plan for therapeutic applications. We can use computational tools to predict T-cell epitopes that might arise from our modifications and experimentally validate these predictions.

2. **Humanization:** Although camelid-origin nanobodies typically have low immunogenicity, humanization can further reduce any potential immune response. We should consider incorporating humanization strategies early on in our design process. This might involve identifying framework regions in the nanobodies that can be swapped with human equivalents while maintaining affinity and specificity.

3. **Stability and Solubility:** It is vital to ensure that any modifications do not adversely affect the inherent stability and solubility of the nanobodies. These properties are critical for their effective use in therapeutic contexts and can be evaluated through both in silico predictions and experimental testing.

4. **Cross-variant Efficacy:** We need to ensure that our design modifications aim for broad-spectrum activity without compromising the nanobody's original neutralizing capabilities. This involves a delicate balance of targeting conserved epitopes while accommodating potential escape mutations.

As we refine our strategy, incorporating these considerations will be crucial in ensuring that the nanobodies are viable for therapeutic use. I look forward to the team's feedback on these points and how we can integrate these considerations into our overall approach.

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Please create an antibody/nanobody design approach to solve this problem. Decide whether you will design antibodies or nanobodies. For your choice, decide whether you will design the antibodies/nanobodies de novo or whether you will modify existing antibodies/nanobodies. If modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies, please specify which antibodies/nanobodies to start with as good candidates for targeting the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. If designing antibodies/nanobodies de novo, please describe how you will propose antibody/nanobody candidates.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you design standard antibodies or nanobodies?

2. Will you design antibodies/nanobodies de novo or will you modify existing antibodies/nanobodies (choose only one)?

3. If modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies, which precise antibodies/nanobodies will you modify (please list 3-4)?

4. If designing antibodies/nanobodies de novo, how exactly will you propose antibody/nanobody candidates?

### Agenda

The meeting focused on developing a strategy using machine learning to create antibodies or nanobodies targeting the newest SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant. The goal is to design these molecules to also have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. We need to decide between designing standard antibodies or nanobodies, and whether to pursue de novo designs or modifications of existing molecules. If modifications are preferred, we should specify which existing antibodies or nanobodies to start with.

### Team Member Input

- **Immunologist:** Suggested focusing on nanobodies due to their smaller size and ability to access different epitopes. Recommended modifying existing nanobodies (Nb21, Ty1, Nb6) to expedite development and enhance cross-variant reactivity. Highlighted the importance of considering immunogenicity and potential humanization.

- **Machine Learning Specialist:** Supported modifying existing nanobodies, emphasizing the use of machine learning techniques such as Graph Neural Networks to predict modifications. Stressed the importance of diverse datasets and an iterative feedback loop with experimental validation to refine models continuously.

- **Computational Biologist:** Agreed with modification strategy, emphasizing the use of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to supplement machine learning predictions. Outlined experimental setups for validating computational predictions and stressed the need for iterative data integration.

- **Scientific Critic:** Supported modification but noted the importance of having criteria for pivoting to de novo designs if necessary. Emphasized the need for clear validation metrics across several parameters (e.g., binding affinity, cross-variant neutralization) and the importance of iterative validation processes.

### Recommendation

Based on the team's insights, I recommend focusing on **modifying existing nanobodies**. This approach leverages the known efficacy and structural data of existing candidates (Nb21, Ty1, Nb6), facilitating a quicker path to experimental validation and deployment. Given the urgency of addressing variants and resource constraints, this strategy is more pragmatic than starting from scratch with de novo designs. We will employ machine learning to predict optimal modifications, supported by molecular dynamics simulations and iterative experimental feedback.

### Answers

1. **Will you design standard antibodies or nanobodies?**
   - **Answer:** Nanobodies
   - **Justification:** Nanobodies offer advantages such as smaller size, enhanced stability, and the ability to access epitopes that traditional antibodies may not, making them ideal for targeting diverse variants.

2. **Will you design antibodies/nanobodies de novo or will you modify existing antibodies/nanobodies (choose only one)?**
   - **Answer:** Modify existing nanobodies.
   - **Justification:** Modifying existing nanobodies (Nb21, Ty1, Nb6) allows us to build on established efficacy and structural insights, accelerating the development process and providing a practical route to addressing emerging variants.

3. **If modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies, which precise antibodies/nanobodies will you modify (please list 3-4)?**
   - **Answer:** Nb21, Ty1, Nb6
   - **Justification:** These nanobodies have demonstrated promising binding characteristics and cross-reactivity with previous variants, providing a strong foundation for further optimization.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Preparation and Model Development:**
   - Compile comprehensive datasets of existing nanobody interactions with spike variants for model training.
   - Develop machine learning models to predict optimal modifications, integrating molecular dynamics simulations for structural insights.

2. **Experimental Validation:**
   - Set up experimental validation pipelines using techniques such as SPR, cryo-EM, and neutralization assays to test modified nanobodies.
   - Implement iterative feedback loops to refine computational models based on experimental outcomes.

3. **Assessment and Adjustment:**
   - Monitor validation metrics closely; be prepared to pivot to de novo designs if modifications fail to meet key criteria.
   - Maintain regular interdisciplinary meetings to ensure alignment and address any emerging challenges promptly.

By following these steps, we can effectively harness machine learning and experimental validation to develop nanobodies that are robust against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.
