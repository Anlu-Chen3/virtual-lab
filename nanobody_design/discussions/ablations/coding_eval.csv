ESM,Machine Learning Specialist,1,3,Make get ESM likelihoods function (modularity). Parse # top mutations from command line (instead of hard-coding). Validate inputs (valid amino acids and # top mutations).
ESM,Machine Learning Specialist,2,3,Parse # top mutations from command line (instead of hard-coding). CUDA availability warning. Try/except for error handling.
ESM,Machine Learning Specialist,3,-2,Only considers conserved regions (harmful). Only considers positive LLR (harmful).
ESM,Machine Learning Specialist,4,3,Validate input amino acid sequence. ESM code in place of random probabilities (though just in comments). Print LLR (and context) in addition to original and changed AAs.
ESM,Machine Learning Specialist,5,2,"Partially replace random probability code with ESM code (in comments, incorrect). Amino acid sequence validation."
AlphaFold,Computational Biologist,1,4,PDB file validation. pLDDT threshold as input instead of hard-coded. Try/except with error logging. Verify pLDDT is provided at all.
AlphaFold,Computational Biologist,2,6,"Arguments like chain IDs and distance threshold as user-provided instead of hard-coded. Try/except error handling. Multiprocessing across PDB files. Interface residue count in addition to ipLDDT. Only include interface residues, not all residues. New function to calculate interface residues."
AlphaFold,Computational Biologist,3,6,Try/except error handling. Error handling on number of chains. Only include interface residues. Separate function to extract pLDDT scores from interface residues. Distance threshold as command line argument. Number of interface & total residues in addition to ipLDDT.
AlphaFold,Computational Biologist,4,3,"Distance threshold as command-line parameter. Calculating interface residues instead of all residues. Additional stats (std, min, max, residue count) in addition to average ipLDDT."
AlphaFold,Computational Biologist,5,5,Try/except error handling. Check if appropriate chains are present. Chains and distance threshold from command line. Calculate interface pLDDT instead of total pLDDT by identifying interface residues. Std pLDDT and # residues in addition to average pLDDT.
Rosetta-XML,Computational Biologist,1,1,Relax prior to energy calculation.
Rosetta-XML,Computational Biologist,2,0,Only comment changes.
Rosetta-XML,Computational Biologist,3,-1,Adds unneeded constraint (harmful).
Rosetta-XML,Computational Biologist,4,0,Changes score function but unclear if it's better or worse.
Rosetta-XML,Computational Biologist,5,1,Adding relax prior to docking.
Rosetta-Python,Computational Biologist,1,2,Try/except error handling. Lower scores first rather than higher since lower binding energy is better.
Rosetta-Python,Computational Biologist,2,1,Try/except error handling.
Rosetta-Python,Computational Biologist,3,1,Better try/except error handling.
Rosetta-Python,Computational Biologist,4,2,Corrects score extraction. More careful error handling.
Rosetta-Python,Computational Biologist,5,3,Try/except error handling. Ascending order for energies since lower is better. Corrects extraction of binding energy header/value.
