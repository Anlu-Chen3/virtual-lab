        "message": "This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\nBased on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:\n\n### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations\nIn each iteration, the order of operations will be:\n- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.\n- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.\n- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.\n\n### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate\n- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.\n- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.\n\n### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking\nAt the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:\n\\[ \\text{Score} = w_1 \\times \\text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \\times \\text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \\times \\text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \\]\n- Initial weights: \\( w_1 = 0.2 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.5 \\), \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.\n\n### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep\n- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.\n\n### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations\n- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.\n\n### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies\n- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.\n- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.\n- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.\n- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.\n- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.\n\n### Explanation of Component Selection\n- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.\n- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).\n- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \\( w_1 = 0.2 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.5 \\), \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.\n- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.\n- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.\n- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.\n\nThis plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.\n\n[end summary 1]\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:\n\nH11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nNb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.\n\nTy1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.\n\nVHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nBased on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.\n\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?\n\n2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?\n\n3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?\n\n4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?\n\n5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?\n\n6. Will you use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or will you change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used?\n\n7. What computational pipeline will you use to design the 92 mutant nanobodies?\n\n8. How many mutations will you introduce in each nanobody?\n\n9. How will you avoid non-specific binding to BSA?\n\nPrincipal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any)."

        "message": "Thank you all for joining today's meeting. Our goal is to refine our approach for designing and testing nanobodies that effectively target recent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Let's focus on the following agenda points:\n\n1. **Target Strain Selection**: We need to decide whether to continue targeting the KP.3 RBD or pivot to other recent variants. Our decision should be guided by both the potential impact on public health and the feasibility of achieving specific binding with our current resources.\n\n2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Considering the binding results we've observed, it\u2019s crucial to choose the most promising wild-type nanobodies for further modification. We must consider both binding specificity and expression levels.\n\n3. **Design Strategy**: Determining the number of mutants per wild-type is essential for balancing diversity and resource utilization. We also need to decide whether to start with wild-type sequences or explore previously successful mutants.\n\n4. **Design Pipeline and Methodology**: We should discuss whether our current computational pipeline is optimal or if modifications could enhance our design process. This includes re-evaluating the weights in our scoring formula and considering additional or alternative computational tools.\n\n5. **Non-specific Binding Concerns**: Strategies to mitigate non-specific binding are crucial. We need to delve into potential improvements in our mutation introduction strategy or evaluation methods to better predict and avoid non-specific interactions.\n\nI encourage each of you to provide your insights and suggestions based on your expertise. Here are some guiding questions for each agenda topic:\n\n- What are the current epidemiological trends, and how should they influence our target strain decision?\n- Which nanobodies have shown promise, and what strategies can ensure our selections maximize specificity and efficacy?\n- How might adjustments to our computational tools and methods improve our outcomes?\n- What specific strategies can we employ to avoid non-specific binding?\n\nLet's begin with the Immunologist and hear your thoughts on the target strain selection and related considerations."

        "message": "Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'll start by addressing the target strain selection. Given the ELISA results and the current epidemiological landscape, it seems that the KP.3 variant, along with its related strains like JN.1 and KP2.3, remains highly relevant. However, we must also consider emerging variants that may present unique mutations conferring vaccine escape or increased transmissibility. Our focus should remain on variants with high public health impact.\n\nRegarding the selection of wild-type nanobodies, Nb21 has demonstrated the most promising cross-reactivity with JN.1 and KP.3, suggesting an inherent adaptability in its binding region. This makes it a strong candidate for further modification. In contrast, the non-specific binding observed in some H11-D4 and VHH-72 mutants indicates potential issues with their frameworks that might not be as easily resolved with additional mutations.\n\nMoving on to the design strategy, I would advocate for a focused approach on Nb21 and Ty1, given their potential for cross-reactivity with minimal non-specific binding. Starting from the successful mutants of these nanobodies may yield more productive results than revisiting the wild-type sequences. Introducing 3-5 mutations in new designs could provide sufficient variability while maintaining structural integrity.\n\nFinally, to address non-specific binding concerns, we should refine our scoring system, perhaps increasing the weight of factors predicting specificity and stability. Incorporating more predictive models of off-target interactions could also help identify problematic mutations earlier in the pipeline.\n\nI look forward to hearing the perspectives of other team members."

        "message": "Thank you, Immunologist, for your detailed insights. I agree with much of what has been said, particularly the focus on Nb21 due to its demonstrated cross-reactivity and potential for specific binding. Here are my thoughts from a machine learning perspective:\n\n1. **Target Strain Selection**: I recommend continuing to target the KP.3 variant while also considering strains like JN.1. Given the computational nature of our work, we can efficiently model multiple strains to identify nanobodies with broad and specific binding capabilities.\n\n2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: As mentioned, the existing data supports focusing on Nb21 and Ty1. However, it's also worth considering if any computational insights suggest unique advantages in other nanobodies, especially if we can enhance their design with our models.\n\n3. **Design Strategy**: From the ML perspective, starting with successful mutants of Nb21 and Ty1 is logical. We have valuable data on these, which can guide further refinement. Using ML, we can explore mutation combinations that might not be intuitive, thereby potentially uncovering novel binding profiles.\n\n4. **Design Pipeline and Methodology**: Our current computational pipeline could be optimized by incorporating additional prediction tools such as graph-based neural networks to evaluate potential binding sites dynamically. Furthermore, re-evaluating the weights in our scoring formula could improve our selection criteria by emphasizing specificity and robustness.\n\n5. **Avoiding Non-specific Binding**: To address non-specific binding, I propose enhancing our model training with datasets that include both specific and non-specific interactions. This could improve our predictive accuracy. Additionally, we should consider integrating a machine learning model trained specifically to predict non-specific interactions.\n\nIn summary, leveraging machine learning more fully in our design pipeline could significantly enhance our ability to predict and optimize interactions. I look forward to hearing more thoughts on how we might integrate these approaches moving forward."

        "message": "Thank you, Machine Learning Specialist, for your insights. Building on the discussions so far, here are my perspectives as a Computational Biologist:\n\n1. **Target Strain Selection**: I concur with the focus on KP.3 and related strains like JN.1. From a structural biology standpoint, these variants present mutations in the spike protein RBD that are critical for antibody/nanobody binding, making them priority targets.\n\n2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: The choice to emphasize Nb21 and Ty1 is strategic, given their demonstrated binding profiles. However, it might be worth considering any structural insights from H11-D4 or VHH-72 mutants that could be salvaged or improved upon, particularly if they offer unique binding sites or configurations.\n\n3. **Design Strategy**: Starting from successful mutants like those of Nb21 makes sense. These mutants have already shown potential, and further refinement can enhance their specificity. Introducing 3-5 mutations seems optimal, as this allows for exploring new binding landscapes without destabilizing the nanobody structure.\n\n4. **Design Pipeline and Methodology**: Our current pipeline utilizing ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta is robust. However, I propose we incorporate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations earlier in the process. MD can provide dynamic insights into nanobody-antigen interactions, helping identify flexible regions or transient interactions that static models might miss.\n\n5. **Avoiding Non-specific Binding**: Enhancing our structural evaluation with MD simulations could predict binding specificity more accurately. We should also consider using Rosetta to perform more extensive docking studies, assessing potential off-target interactions against a panel of irrelevant proteins like BSA.\n\nIn summary, integrating more dynamic structural analyses into our pipeline could enhance our understanding of binding interactions and specificity. I look forward to seeing how these insights can be incorporated into our workflow."

        "message": "Thank you, Computational Biologist. I appreciate the comprehensive insights provided by the team. As the Scientific Critic, my role is to ensure that our strategies are both scientifically sound and feasible. Here are my thoughts:\n\n1. **Target Strain Selection**: While continuing with KP.3 and related strains is a logical choice given its relevance, we must ensure that our justification is backed by up-to-date epidemiological data. It's essential to verify that these strains present sufficiently distinct challenges that warrant our focused efforts, rather than spreading resources too thin across multiple strains.\n\n2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: The decision to focus on Nb21 and Ty1 due to their promising cross-reactivity is reasonable. However, I would caution against completely disregarding H11-D4 and VHH-72 without further analysis of their structural data. There might be underexplored potential in these nanobodies with targeted mutations that improve specificity.\n\n3. **Design Strategy**: Starting with previously successful mutants and introducing 3-5 mutations is a sound approach. However, it's crucial to define clear criteria for what constitutes a \"successful\" mutant. It should not only be based on binding affinity but also on specificity and a lack of non-specific binding.\n\n4. **Design Pipeline and Methodology**: The existing pipeline is solid, but as suggested, adding molecular dynamics simulations could indeed provide valuable insights. However, we need to assess the computational cost versus the expected benefit carefully. Additionally, the Machine Learning Specialist\u2019s suggestion to integrate models that predict non-specific interactions should be further explored and validated against existing datasets.\n\n5. **Avoiding Non-specific Binding**: We need empirical validation of any computational predictions regarding specificity. To this end, enhancing our evaluation with docking studies against a library of unrelated proteins, as proposed, could be effective. However, we must ensure these additional steps do not overextend our resources without clear anticipated benefits.\n\nIn summary, while the proposed strategies are generally sound, we need to ensure they are backed by solid data and are computationally feasible. Rigorous validation and a clear focus on specificity will be crucial in our next steps. I look forward to discussing these points further."

Addressing the question about emerging variants, it\u2019s crucial to continuously monitor the global landscape for any new mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that could influence our targeting strategy. As of the latest data, the variant of interest is the EG.5 (Eris) variant, which has been noted for its increased transmissibility and potential to partially evade immune responses. While our primary focus remains on KP.3 and related strains, keeping an eye on EG.5 could be beneficial, especially since its mutations might overlap with those in KP.3, offering opportunities for cross-reactivity.\n\nIf we opt to account for such emerging variants, we should ensure our computational models are adaptable and capable of integrating new variant data quickly. This approach will allow us to pivot if necessary, ensuring our nanobodies remain effective against the most relevant strains.\n\nIn summary, while we should stay the course with KP.3 for now, building a flexible framework that can quickly incorporate new data on emerging variants is prudent. This strategy will maximize the relevance and utility of our nanobodies in ongoing and future waves of the pandemic. I look forward to the team's thoughts on this potential adjustment."

From a machine learning perspective, adaptability is indeed crucial.\n\n**Integrating Machine Learning Models**: To enhance our predictions for non-specific interactions, we can consider employing models like graph neural networks (GNNs) and ensemble learning methods. GNNs are particularly suitable for this task as they can effectively model biological structures by capturing the relationships between amino acid residues in a protein complex. These models can help predict binding sites and assess the likelihood of non-specific interactions.\n\n**Validation of Models**: To validate these models, we should use a robust dataset comprising both specific and non-specific binding interactions. This dataset can be derived from available structural databases, augmented with experimental data, if possible. We can employ cross-validation techniques to ensure the model\u2019s predictive accuracy and generalizability.\n\n**Flexibility and Updates**: By designing these models to learn continuously, we can update them with new data on emerging variants like EG.5, ensuring our predictions remain up-to-date. This continuous learning process is essential for adapting to new challenges posed by viral evolution.\n\nIn summary, using advanced ML models and maintaining a dynamic, adaptable system can significantly enhance our ability to predict specific and non-specific interactions, providing a robust framework for both current and emerging variants.

I\u2019d like to address the computational aspect of incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which can indeed provide a dynamic view of the nanobody-antigen interactions.\n\n**Computational Cost of MD Simulations**: While MD simulations are computationally intense, they offer unparalleled insights into the conformational flexibility and stability of protein complexes. To manage resources effectively, I recommend using a tiered approach: \n- **Initial Screening**: Use fast, coarse-grained MD simulations or enhanced sampling techniques (e.g., umbrella sampling) to rapidly identify promising candidates.\n- **Detailed Analysis**: For the top candidates from this initial screen, conduct more detailed all-atom MD simulations. This approach balances computational demand with the need for detailed dynamic insights.\n\n**Enhancing Predictions**: By incorporating MD simulations, we can identify transient interactions and conformational changes that static models might overlook. This can be particularly useful for understanding binding specificity and avoiding non-specific interactions. Additionally, integrating these findings with machine learning models can improve their predictive power by providing more accurate input data.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: We should start by selecting a subset of nanobodies, perhaps those showing the most promise in our existing static models, and apply MD simulations to refine their structural predictions. This method will help tailor our approach to the most relevant candidates while conserving computational resources.\n\nIn summary, a strategic integration of MD simulations into our pipeline can enhance our understanding of nanobody dynamics and specificity. I\u2019m eager to discuss how we can implement these simulations in alignment with our overall goals."

        "message": "Thank you, Computational Biologist, for outlining the benefits and considerations of incorporating molecular dynamics. From my perspective as a Scientific Critic, here are some critical points to consider:\n\n**Validation and Efficacy of ML Models**: While the integration of machine learning models such as graph neural networks is promising, it's crucial to ensure that these models are rigorously validated against diverse datasets. This validation should not only focus on specific binding interactions but also extensively explore false positives where non-specific binding might be predicted. It's important to recognize that model predictions must be experimentally confirmed to build confidence in their utility.\n\n**Resource Allocation for MD Simulations**: The tiered approach to MD simulations suggested by the Computational Biologist is sensible. However, we must remain cognizant of the potential for over-reliance on computational predictions. It's key to establish clear criteria for progressing from coarse-grained to detailed simulations to avoid expending resources on refining nanobodies that may not have significant practical potential.\n\n**Balancing Flexibility and Focus**: As we aim to adapt to emerging variants like EG.5, there is a risk of diffusing our efforts. A focused approach on KP.3 and closely related variants should remain our priority unless significant evidence suggests an urgent need to pivot. The flexibility to adapt should be built more into our computational frameworks, allowing rapid updates and re-assessments without fundamentally shifting our experimental focus prematurely.\n\n**Empirical Validation**: Finally, a strong feedback loop between computational predictions and experimental validations is essential. We need to ensure that our computational models and predictions are continuously refined based on empirical data, especially regarding binding specificity and non-specific interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while we pursue sophisticated computational approaches, a balanced and empirically grounded approach will be key to ensuring the practical success of our nanobody designs. I look forward to how we can integrate these insights into our strategy effectively."

Specific metrics such as binding affinity, specificity, and structural stability should match empirical observations.\n   - **Reproducibility**: Predictions must be consistently reproducible under varied conditions and datasets, demonstrating robustness in the face of biological variability.\n\n2. **Resource Management**:\n   - While the tiered approach to MD simulations is sound, it is crucial to establish clear decision points at each step to ensure resource allocation remains focused on candidates with the highest potential. Regular checkpoints should be instituted to reassess whether further computational or experimental efforts are warranted.\n\n3. **Feedback Loop Implementation**:\n   - Successful integration of feedback from experimental data into computational models should be a priority. Establishing a structured process where experimental results are systematically used to refine computational models will enhance predictive accuracy and reliability.\n\n4. **Balancing Flexibility and Specificity**:\n   - While it's important to remain agile and responsive to emerging variants, we must balance this with a focus on depth over breadth.

        "message": "Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).\n\nAs a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:\n\nH11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nNb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.\n\nTy1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.\n\nVHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nBased on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.\n\n\nAs a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?\n\n2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?\n\n3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?\n\n4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?\n\n5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?\n\n6. Will you use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or will you change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used?\n\n7. What computational pipeline will you use to design the 92 mutant nanobodies?\n\n8. How many mutations will you introduce in each nanobody?\n\n9. How will you avoid non-specific binding to BSA?\n\nYour summary should take the following form.\n\n### Agenda\n\nRestate the agenda in your own words.\n\n### Team Member Input\n\nSummarize all of the important points raised by each team member. This is to ensure that key details are preserved for future meetings.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nProvide your expert recommendation regarding the agenda.
