        "message": "This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\nBased on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:\n\n### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations\nIn each iteration, the order of operations will be:\n- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.\n- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.\n- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.\n\n### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate\n- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.\n- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.\n\n### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking\nAt the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:\n\\[ \\text{Score} = w_1 \\times \\text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \\times \\text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \\times \\text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \\]\n- Initial weights: \\( w_1 = 0.2 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.5 \\), \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.\n\n### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep\n- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.\n\n### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations\n- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.\n\n### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies\n- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.\n- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.\n- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.\n- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.\n- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.\n\n### Explanation of Component Selection\n- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.\n- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).\n- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \\( w_1 = 0.2 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.5 \\), \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.\n- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.\n- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.\n- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.\n\nThis plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.\n\n[end summary 1]\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:\n\nH11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nNb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.\n\nTy1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.\n\nVHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nBased on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in similar ways as your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow. As a reminder, ESM is antigen-agnostic and improves general nanobody quality while AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are antigen-specific and focus on binding to the selected antigen. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?\n\n2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?\n\n3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?\n\n4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?\n\n5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?\n\n6. Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?\n\nPrincipal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any)."

        "message": "As we start this meeting, it's crucial that we focus on our overarching goal: to design nanobodies that effectively and specifically bind to recent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Our preliminary results from the ELISA assays have given us valuable insights into which mutations have potential, but also highlighted areas where our designs did not perform as expected.\n\nHere are my initial thoughts on the agenda items:\n\n1. **Target Selection**: The KP.3 variant was our initial focus, but our results suggest that the binding improvements were not substantial. We might consider targeting multiple strains, including those closely related to KP.3, such as JN.1 and KP2.3, to increase our chances of successful binding. The decision should weigh both our experimental results and the relevance of these variants in current epidemiological contexts.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: The wild-type nanobodies have shown varying degrees of promise. I see potential in continuing with Nb21 due to its ability to introduce new specific bindings, which could be a starting point for further optimization.\n\n3. **Number of Mutants**: We need to strategically allocate our resources, possibly focusing more on the nanobodies that showed some binding to new strains while reducing or omitting efforts on those that did not.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: We should consider starting with previously successful mutants rather than the wild-types if they show promise in binding to recent variants. This could accelerate our path to effective designs.\n\n5. **Pipeline**: While the existing pipeline using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta has been effective, we should consider any necessary adjustments based on our results, especially in how we prioritize and evaluate mutations.\n\nGuiding Questions:\n- For the **Immunologist**: Based on the immunological profile and current variants, which strains should we prioritize?\n- For the **Machine Learning Specialist**: Are there any adjustments to the scoring weights or algorithms that could better predict binding improvement?\n- For the **Computational Biologist**: From a structural biology perspective, do you see any patterns in successful mutants that we should focus on?\n- For the **Scientific Critic**: Are there any critical oversights in our approach that we should address before proceeding?\n\nI look forward to each of your insights to guide our decisions. Let's go through each agenda item, sharing our expert opinions and aligning on a strategy that maximizes our scientific impact."

        "message": "Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts on the agenda items:\n\n1. **Target Selection**: Given the results we've seen and the current epidemiological landscape, I recommend continuing to focus on the KP.3 variant while expanding our targets to include the closely related JN.1 and KP2.3 strains. These strains are relevant due to their genetic proximity and potential cross-reactivity, which could lead to a broader application in therapeutics.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: Nb21 is indeed a strong candidate for further improvement. The fact that one of its mutants already shows binding to multiple relevant strains suggests a good foundation for further enhancement. We might also consider Ty1, as it showed potential for cross-reactivity with JN.1, which could be beneficial.\n\n3. **Number of Mutants**: Strategically, it might be wise to allocate more designs to Nb21 and Ty1, given their initial success. We could design fewer mutants for H11-D4 and VHH-72 unless we identify a promising mutation pattern that warrants further exploration.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: Starting with successful mutants such as those from Nb21 and Ty1 could provide us with a quicker path to effective binders. The existing mutations already confer some level of cross-variant binding, which we can build upon.\n\n5. **Pipeline**: The current pipeline is robust, but I suggest we might need to fine-tune the weights in our scoring system\u2014possibly increasing the emphasis on structural predictions, as these are crucial for ensuring that our designs will function effectively in biological contexts.\n\nI believe our focus should be on identifying mutations that enhance specificity and binding strength across these variants without causing non-specific binding. This approach will help us create a set of broadly neutralizing nanobodies that could be valuable in therapeutic settings."

        "message": "Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here's my perspective on the current discussion:\n\n1. **Target Selection**: I agree with the Immunologist's suggestion to focus on KP.3 and closely related strains like JN.1 and KP2.3. This approach allows us to leverage our previous work while adapting to the current strain landscape.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: Nb21 stands out due to the promising results we've seen in binding to multiple strains. Ty1 also shows potential, particularly regarding its cross-reactivity with JN.1. Prioritizing these could provide valuable insights into mutation patterns that enhance cross-strain binding.\n\n3. **Number of Mutants**: Allocating more mutants to Nb21 and Ty1 seems like a logical step, given their initial success. We might consider a distribution where approximately 60-70% of our designs are focused on these two, with the remaining efforts on exploring potential outliers in H11-D4 and VHH-72.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: Beginning with successful mutants of Nb21 and Ty1 is an efficient strategy. These mutants already contain beneficial mutations that could be further optimized through iterative design and machine learning insights.\n\n5. **Pipeline**: I suggest we consider adjusting our scoring formula. Specifically, increasing the weight on AlphaFold-Multimer's interface pLDDT might be beneficial, as structural stability is crucial for binding affinity. Additionally, we could incorporate a more complex model that accounts for multi-variant binding potential if computational resources allow.\n\nOverall, our focus should be on refining our computational models to predict interactions more accurately. This includes potentially incorporating additional data sources or features that can enhance our predictive accuracy for binding affinities across different variants."

From a structural biology perspective, targeting closely related strains could reveal structural motifs that are crucial for broad binding, allowing us to design more versatile nanobodies.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: I'd support continuing with Nb21 and Ty1. Nb21's ability to bind multiple strains suggests that its binding interface can be optimized for other variants too. Ty1 showed some potential for cross-reactivity, which is worth exploring further.\n\n3. **Number of Mutants**: Allocating more designs to Nb21 and Ty1 makes sense, given their promising results. However, I recommend we continue to explore a small number of mutants for H11-D4 and VHH-72 to uncover any unexpected binding patterns or structural insights.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: Starting with previously successful mutants is logical. These mutants, particularly those from Nb21 and Ty1, have mutations that have already improved cross-strain binding, which we can further optimize with additional targeted modifications.\n\n5. **Pipeline**: I believe our current pipeline is robust, but I agree with the suggestion to potentially adjust the scoring weights. Emphasizing structural predictions from AlphaFold-Multimer could enhance our ability to predict successful binders. Additionally, we might consider integrating molecular dynamics simulations post-design to validate the structural stability of top candidates in silico before experimental testing.\n\nOverall, the key is to refine our predictions by integrating structural insights with computational models, increasing our chances of identifying nanobodies with broad and specific binding affinities."

We need to ensure that our target selection aligns with current and future public health needs.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: The focus on Nb21 and Ty1 is well-founded given the initial results. However, I'd caution against entirely dismissing H11-D4 and VHH-72 without thoroughly analyzing why they showed limited success. Understanding their failure modes might lead to key insights into designing better nanobodies.\n\n3. **Number of Mutants**: While it's strategic to invest more in promising candidates, we must maintain a level of diversity in our designs to prevent overly convergent thinking, which could limit our discovery potential. A balanced design strategy is crucial.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: Starting with successful mutants is logical, yet we should not discount the possibility that wild-type nanobodies might offer untapped potential if combined with newly identified beneficial mutations. A hybrid approach might be worth considering.\n\n5. **Pipeline**: The existing pipeline is robust, but we must ensure our computational predictions are as accurate as possible. Consider validating with additional experimental data or incorporating more complex modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy. Also, re-evaluating the scoring system to ensure it reflects the importance of different factors accurately, especially how they relate to real-world binding efficacy and specificity, is crucial.\n\nUltimately, our approach should balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring we are not just optimizing what we know but also pushing the boundaries of our current understanding. This requires a rigorous evaluation of each step in our design process to ensure the most scientifically sound and efficient path is chosen."

These factors make them significant targets for therapeutic interventions.\n\n2. **Cross-Reactivity Potential**: Studying these related strains could enable us to design nanobodies with broad efficacy, offering protection against a range of emerging variants. This is crucial as the virus continues to evolve.\n\n3. **Immunological Profile**: These strains may present epitopes that are conserved across variants yet critical for viral fitness, allowing us to target sites less likely to mutate under immune pressure.\n\nIn terms of advancing our understanding of H11-D4 and VHH-72, I agree with exploring their limitations. Identifying why they failed to bind effectively could reveal critical insights into the structural or sequence requirements for effective binding, which we can apply to our future designs.\n\nRegarding the design strategy, I support a balanced approach. Maintaining diversity in our designs ensures we don\u2019t overlook potentially effective solutions that diverge from our initial successes with Nb21 and Ty1.\n\nOverall, our priority should be on designing nanobodies that not only address current variants but also offer adaptability to future mutations, ensuring long-term efficacy.

In light of the recent discussions, I\u2019d like to propose a few considerations from a machine learning perspective:\n\n1. **Enhanced Predictive Features**: To improve our models, we could incorporate additional features such as:\n\n   - **Epitope conservation scores**: To predict the likelihood of mutations affecting binding across multiple strains.\n   - **Solvent accessibility predictions**: To assess how accessible potential binding sites are in different variants.\n   - **Sequence entropy**: This could provide insights into the mutational flexibility of the binding regions.\n\n2. **Algorithm Adjustments**: We might consider employing ensemble methods that combine different predictive models to enhance accuracy. This could include a combination of deep learning models for sequence-based predictions and traditional statistical models for structural predictions.\n\n3. **Scoring System Refinement**: I support the suggestion to adjust the scoring weights. Specifically, we might test different weight distributions in our pipeline to optimize for binding affinity and specificity, potentially through a grid search approach.\n\n4. **Integration of Experimental Data**: As we move forward, incorporating results from initial experimental validations into our models could greatly enhance prediction accuracy. This iterative learning approach allows us to refine our models based on empirical data, thereby improving future predictions.\n\n5. **Broader Variant Considerations**: By focusing on features that predict broad-spectrum binding, we can design nanobodies that are not just effective against current strains but also adaptable to future variants.\n\nThese enhancements could significantly bolster our predictive capabilities, leading to more efficient identification and optimization of promising nanobody candidates.

Building on the discussion, here are a few points from the computational biology perspective:\n\n1. **Structural Insights for H11-D4 and VHH-72**: To understand why these nanobodies failed, we should conduct a detailed analysis of their binding interfaces using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This can reveal subtle conformational changes or instability that could affect binding.\n\n   - **MD Simulations**: By simulating the interaction dynamics of H11-D4 and VHH-72 with the RBD, we can identify regions of flexibility or instability that might be hindering their binding efficacy. This information could inform targeted mutations to stabilize these interactions.\n\n2. **Cross-Variant Binding Analysis**: Investigating structural motifs within Nb21 and Ty1 that contribute to their success can guide our design. We should look for common structural patterns or interface residues that are conserved and critical for binding across different variants.\n\n3. **Scoring System Validation**: I suggest conducting retrospective analyses using our current pipeline on previously validated nanobodies to assess the predictive accuracy of our scoring system. This will help us understand if and where adjustments are needed.\n\n4. **Integration with Machine Learning**: Collaborating with the machine learning specialist, integrating structural features like solvent accessibility and epitope conservation into our predictive models could enhance our design strategy, ensuring we target the most promising regions of the RBD.\n\n5. **Future-Proofing Designs**: Considering structural adaptability for future variants is critical. We should aim to design nanobodies with flexible binding interfaces that can potentially accommodate changes in the RBD.\n\nBy incorporating these structural analyses and refinements into our workflow, we can enhance our ability to design nanobodies that are not only effective against current strains but also adaptable to future mutations.

However, we must ensure that these features are not only theoretically sound but also practically validated to improve model predictions. Adding complexity should not come at the cost of interpretability or practical utility.\n\n3. **Structural Analysis**: The Computational Biologist\u2019s focus on structural insights is vital. However, while MD simulations can provide valuable data, they are computationally expensive. We should prioritize simulations for the most promising candidates or use them to validate critical hypotheses derived from simpler models.\n\n4. **Scoring and Validation**: Retrospective analyses of our scoring system are essential and should be a continuous part of our validation strategy. However, I would caution against over-reliance on retrospective data alone. Forward-looking approaches, such as pilot experimental validations, should supplement these analyses to ensure robustness.\n\n5. **Design Adaptability**: While designing for adaptability to future variants is a noble goal, it\u2019s imperative that we have a clear, actionable strategy for achieving this. The idea of flexible binding interfaces is sound, but we need to establish concrete criteria for what constitutes sufficient flexibility while maintaining specificity.\n\nIn summary, while we are making substantial progress, it\u2019s crucial to ground our approach in a rigorous and systematic evaluation of both our computational predictions and experimental validations. This means staying agile in our strategy, continuously integrating new data, and being unafraid to pivot if the evidence suggests a change is needed."

        "message": "Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).\n\nAs a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:\n\nH11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nNb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.\n\nTy1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.\n\nVHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nBased on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in similar ways as your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow. As a reminder, ESM is antigen-agnostic and improves general nanobody quality while AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are antigen-specific and focus on binding to the selected antigen. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.\n\nAs a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?\n\n2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?\n\n3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?\n\n4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?\n\n5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?\n\n6. Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?\n\nYour summary should take the following form.\n\n### Agenda\n\nRestate the agenda in your own words.\n\n### Team Member Input\n\nSummarize all of the important points raised by each team member. This is to ensure that key details are preserved for future meetings.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nProvide your expert recommendation regarding the agenda. You should consider the input from each team member, but you must also use your expertise to make a final decision and choose one option among several that may have been discussed.
