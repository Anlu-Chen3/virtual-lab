Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.

As a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.


As a reference, here are the agenda questions from those meetings, which must be answered here as well:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

3. **Mutant Distribution**:
   - **Feedback**: The distribution of mutants (60 for Nb21 and 32 for Ty1) is reasonable, but the decision lacks detail on why this specific allocation was chosen over others.
   - **Improvement**: Provide a more detailed explanation of the criteria used to determine the number of mutants for each nanobody, such as past performance metrics or structural considerations.

4. **Starting with Successful Mutants**:
   - **Feedback**: The choice to start with previously successful mutants is logical. However, the answer could benefit from more detail on how these mutants will be further optimized.
   - **Improvement**: Outline specific strategies or criteria for selecting mutations to introduce in these mutants to enhance their binding profiles further.
