        "message": "This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\nBased on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:\n\n### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations\nIn each iteration, the order of operations will be:\n- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.\n- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.\n- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.\n\n### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate\n- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.\n- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.\n\n### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking\nAt the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:\n\\[ \\text{Score} = w_1 \\times \\text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \\times \\text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \\times \\text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \\]\n- Initial weights: \\( w_1 = 0.2 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.5 \\), \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.\n\n### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep\n- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.\n\n### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations\n- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.\n\n### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies\n- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.\n- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.\n- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.\n- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.\n- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.\n\n### Explanation of Component Selection\n- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.\n- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).\n- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \\( w_1 = 0.2 \\), \\( w_2 = 0.5 \\), \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.\n- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.\n- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.\n- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.\n\nThis plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.\n\n[end summary 1]\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:\n\nH11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nNb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.\n\nTy1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.\n\nVHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nBased on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.\n\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?\n\n2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?\n\n3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?\n\n4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?\n\n5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?\n\n6. Will you use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or will you change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used?\n\n7. What computational pipeline will you use to design the 92 mutant nanobodies?\n\n8. How many mutations will you introduce in each nanobody?\n\n9. How will you avoid non-specific binding to BSA?\n\nPrincipal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any)."

        "message": "As we begin this meeting, I'd like to focus on how we can leverage the insights gained from our previous experiments to enhance the specificity and affinity of our nanobodies against the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here's a quick breakdown of what I'm thinking per the agenda questions:\n\n1. **Target Variant**: The ELISA results indicate that while the KP.3 RBD is an important target, we might consider broadening our approach to include other closely related variants, such as JN.1 and KP2.3. This could enhance the cross-reactivity of our nanobodies while ensuring specificity.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: Based on the binding capabilities and potential for further modification, we should consider focusing on those that have shown promise in binding to multiple strains, such as Nb21 and Ty1.\n\n3. **Design Allocation**: Since we have 92 mutants to design, we should strategically distribute them based on the potential of each nanobody to achieve specific binding. For instance, more resources could be allocated to Nb21, given its promising result with one of the mutants.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: It seems wise to build upon the mutant nanobodies that have already demonstrated enhanced binding properties, such as the mutant from Nb21 with improved binding to multiple strains.\n\n5. **Computational Tools and Methodology**: While our previous workflow using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta has been fruitful, we should consider any updates or alterations that could improve efficiency or prediction accuracy. \n\n6. **Mutational Strategy**: I suggest we carefully plan the number of mutations to maintain protein stability while enhancing binding specificity. We should also focus on avoiding non-specific binding to BSA, possibly by evaluating surface properties and charge distribution.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, I would like each of you to provide your perspectives based on your expertise. Specifically:\n\n- **Immunologist**: Insights on targeting additional strains and considerations for immunogenicity and specificity.\n- **Machine Learning Specialist**: Suggestions on computational enhancements or alternative approaches.\n- **Computational Biologist**: Advice on mutational strategy and structural prediction improvements.\n- **Scientific Critic**: An evaluation of our previous approach and potential pitfalls to avoid in this iteration.\n\nLet's proceed with this framework and address the questions. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and any additional considerations you believe are crucial."

        "agent": "Immunologist",
        "message": "Thank you. As we consider the next steps, here are my thoughts:\n\n1. **Target Variant**: I agree with focusing on both the KP.3 and JN.1 RBDs, given their close relation and the promising result from Nb21. Broadening our target to include these variants could enhance the versatility of our nanobodies. However, the KP.3 variant remains a priority due to its unique evolutionary trajectory.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: We should prioritize Nb21 and Ty1, considering their mutants have already shown potential cross-reactivity. The ability of Nb21 to bind to multiple strains suggests it might be a good scaffold for further optimization.\n\n3. **Design Allocation**: Given the promising results with specific mutants, particularly from Nb21, allocating more resources to this nanobody makes sense. I propose a split of about 40 mutants for Nb21, 30 for Ty1, and the remaining 22 spread across potential promising candidates from VHH-72 and H11-D4 that show high specificity without cross-reactivity.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: Starting from previously designed mutants, such as the ones from Nb21 and Ty1 that showed enhanced binding, is logical. These give us a baseline to introduce further mutations that might enhance broad specificity.\n\n5. **Computational Tools and Methodology**: Given the complexity of predicting binding specificity, I suggest we continue with our previous computational pipeline but consider integrating additional computational filtering for non-specific binding sites, particularly hydrophobic patches known to interact with BSA.\n\n6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: We should incorporate computational assessments of hydrophobic and electrostatic surface properties. In vitro, using competitive binding assays during initial screenings could help eliminate non-specific binders early in the process.\n\nOverall, refining our selections with these considerations could lead to an improved and more specific nanobody set."

This dual targeting could maximize the utility of our nanobodies across different strains.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: Nb21 and Ty1 appear to be the most promising candidates based on their mutant performance. Focusing on these would likely yield the most productive results.\n\n3. **Design Allocation**: I support the proposed allocation strategy. Concentrating efforts on Nb21 and Ty1, with a slight emphasis on those that showed cross-reactivity, seems optimal.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: I recommend beginning with the previously successful mutants, as this leverages existing knowledge and data to build upon.\n\n5. **Computational Tools and Methodology**: I suggest maintaining our current pipeline but integrating additional machine learning models to predict non-specific interactions. We could use transfer learning approaches to refine predictions using existing datasets of known specific and non-specific binders.\n\n6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: To refine our approach, we could apply clustering methods on the computed physicochemical properties of nanobodies to identify features common to non-specific binders. This could guide our design to avoid similar properties in new mutants.\n\nIn summary, enhancing our computational predictions with additional machine learning models could improve the specificity of our designs and reduce non-specific binding potential."

This approach maximizes the potential utility of our nanobodies and aligns with the goal of broad specificity.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: Focus should indeed be on Nb21 and Ty1, given their potential demonstrated by certain mutants. They provide a solid foundation with demonstrated adaptability.\n\n3. **Design Allocation**: I agree with concentrating efforts on Nb21 and Ty1. However, I suggest a slightly broader allocation for Ty1 due to its moderate binding profile, which might provide insights into mutational impacts on binding affinity and specificity.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: Building on mutants that have shown success is a sound strategy. This allows us to use existing structural insights to guide additional modifications.\n\n5. **Computational Tools and Methodology**: Our current workflow is robust, but I propose refining our structural predictions by integrating enhanced sampling techniques in Rosetta, such as using Flexible Backbone Design, to explore a wider conformational space. This could help capture dynamics potentially missed in static predictions.\n\n6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: I recommend using computational alanine scanning to identify and minimize potential non-specific interaction sites. Additionally, evaluating solvation energies might provide insights into optimizing nanobody surface characteristics to reduce non-specific binding.\n\nIn conclusion, my focus would be on enhancing structural prediction fidelity and ensuring our computational pipeline can effectively predict and minimize non-specific interactions. These improvements, coupled with the existing strengths of our approach, should significantly aid in the design of specific, high-affinity nanobodies."

        "message": "Thank you for the opportunity to provide my critique. I have several points to raise:\n\n1. **Target Variant**: While targeting both KP.3 and JN.1 is logical due to their close relationship, we should remain vigilant about the possibility of new variants emerging. Therefore, consider including a strategy for rapid adaptation to other potential variants as well.\n\n2. **Wild-Type Selection**: The focus on Nb21 and Ty1 is reasonable, but don't dismiss the potential benefits of a more exploratory approach that includes a few mutants from other wild types. This could uncover unexpected interactions or binding capabilities.\n\n3. **Design Allocation**: While focusing on the most promising nanobodies is efficient, ensure that the selection of mutants still allows for sufficient diversity. A strong focus on specific mutants might inadvertently narrow the search space too much, leading to missed opportunities.\n\n4. **Starting Point for Design**: Building on previous mutants is efficient; however, be cautious not to introduce too many mutations at once, as this can destabilize the nanobodies. Balance is key.\n\n5. **Computational Tools and Methodology**: The current pipeline is solid, but consider complementing it with additional methods to assess conformational flexibility, which can be critical for binding. Techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations could provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of nanobodies upon binding.\n\n6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: While computational predictions are improving, the in vitro validation of non-specifically binding nanobodies should be prioritized for removal early in the experimental pipeline. Incorporating wet-lab feedback iteratively into the computational design process is crucial for refining predictions.\n\nIn summary, diversification of targets and approaches, careful consideration of mutational impacts, and iterative feedback between computational predictions and experimental validations will be essential to ensure the robustness and specificity of the nanobody designs."

        "message": "Thank you. Addressing the follow-up question regarding prioritizing specificity over affinity, my perspective is as follows:\n\nSpecificity must be our primary focus, especially given the problem of non-specific binding observed in some mutants. While high affinity is desirable, specificity ensures that the nanobodies interact primarily with target antigens rather than off-target proteins, such as BSA. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Binding Interface Optimization**: Emphasizing mutations that fine-tune interactions at the antigen-binding interface could enhance specificity. We should prioritize mutations that target unique epitopes on the KP.3 and JN.1 RBDs not present on other proteins like BSA.\n\n2. **Cross-Reactivity Management**: We can evaluate specificity by looking at cross-reactivity patterns in our ELISA assays. A nanobody that binds strongly to multiple, closely related variants but not to a broader array of non-target proteins is desired.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing and Adjustment**: During in vitro testing, we can measure the binding of our nanobodies to a panel of off-target proteins to refine specificity. Computational modelling of these interactions can also provide insights.\n\n4. **Threshold Setting**: We might define an acceptable threshold for affinity to ensure adequate binding while focusing predominantly on achieving specificity.\n\nBy strategically balancing these factors, we can optimize our nanobody candidates to perform effectively against SARS-CoV-2 variants without compromising specificity."

Regarding the integration of transfer learning into our workflow, here's how it might be beneficial:\n\n1. **Leveraging Pre-trained Models**: We can utilize pre-trained models on large-scale protein datasets to enhance our predictions. Transfer learning allows us to fine-tune these models using our nanobody data, improving prediction accuracy for binding specificity and non-specific interactions.\n\n2. **Data Augmentation**: By incorporating transfer learning, we can effectively expand our training dataset through synthetic data generation. This involves using known binding and non-binding sequences to create a more diverse training set, which helps the model generalize better to unseen nanobody variants.\n\n3. **Improving Classification of Non-Specific Binders**: Transfer learning can be particularly useful in distinguishing specific from non-specific binders. By adapting models trained on similar classification tasks, we can improve our ability to predict and design nanobodies with reduced non-specific binding.\n\n4. **Integration with Current Pipeline**: We can seamlessly integrate these models within our existing computational workflow, using them to prioritize candidates before progressing to structural predictions with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta.\n\nOverall, transfer learning offers a sophisticated approach to refining our predictions, leveraging vast existing datasets to improve the specificity and efficacy of our nanobody designs against SARS-CoV-2 variants."

This is crucial for understanding the binding process's kinetics and affinities, particularly in complex systems such as protein-protein interactions.\n\n3. **Resource Allocation**: While enhanced sampling is computationally intensive, focusing on the most promising candidates (e.g., from Nb21 and Ty1) would allow us to balance depth of analysis with available resources. We can initially apply these techniques to a subset of designs before wider application.\n\n4. **Integration with Current Timeline**: To incorporate these techniques effectively, we can set up a parallel workflow where promising candidates identified in initial rounds of prediction undergo enhanced sampling. This approach ensures our timeline remains efficient while gaining deeper insights.\n\nImplementing these methods will complement our existing pipeline, enhancing our understanding of nanobody dynamics and binding, ultimately leading to more robust design candidates."

Here are my thoughts on enhancing our approach based on the follow-up questions and team inputs:\n\n1. **Iterative Feedback Loop**: Establishing a robust feedback loop between computational predictions and experimental validations is critical. We should aim to regularly integrate experimental data back into the computational models to refine predictions iteratively. For instance, any discrepancies observed between predicted and actual binding specificities should be used to update computational parameters or retrain models.\n\n2. **Efficiency and Early Elimination**: To efficiently eliminate non-specific binders early, I recommend implementing a rapid initial screening step. This could involve computational simulations that focus on predicting non-specific interactions before detailed structural simulations. Coupling this with high-throughput experimental assays could quickly filter out suboptimal candidates.\n\n3. **Cross-validation**: Emphasize cross-validation within computational predictions to assess prediction reliability. Using different training and validation sets, especially for models predicting non-specific binding, will help ensure robustness and reliability.\n\n4. **Resource Allocation**: While enhanced sampling and additional computational techniques are beneficial, it's crucial to monitor computational resource use. Prioritize candidates with the highest potential for specificity and binding affinity for these intensive analyses to maintain efficiency.\n\nIn summary, maintaining a cycle of continuous refinement based on empirical data and ensuring rigorous validation of computational models will be key to achieving our design goals efficiently."

        "message": "Thank you. To refine our selection criteria for mutations focusing on specificity, here are some considerations:\n\n1. **Epitope Mapping**: We should perform comprehensive epitope mapping of the KP.3 and JN.1 RBDs to identify regions with unique structural features. Mutations should be selected to enhance interactions with these unique regions, thus reducing the potential for non-specific binding.\n\n2. **Mutational Hotspots**: Focus on known mutational hotspots that are less prone to conservation across different proteins. This ensures that our nanobodies are more tailored to the specific RBDs of interest and less likely to bind nonspecifically.\n\n3. **Interface Analysis**: Conduct detailed analyses of the antigen-binding interfaces of our nanobodies. Prioritize mutations that increase hydrogen bonding, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions specifically at these interfaces, while minimizing general surface interactions.\n\n4. **In Silico Screening**: Utilize computational tools to pre-screen mutations for their potential to disrupt non-specific interactions before experimental validation. This can help narrow down candidates that are more likely to provide specific binding.\n\n5. **Immunogenicity Assessment**: Although not the primary focus, assessing potential immunogenicity of mutations can provide insight into their long-term viability as therapeutic agents, ensuring we maintain specificity without triggering unwanted immune responses.\n\nBy applying these refined criteria, we can enhance the specificity of our nanobody designs against the target variants, potentially increasing their efficacy and safety for therapeutic applications."

In terms of leveraging transfer learning for our nanobody design, here\u2019s how we can prioritize datasets and enhance our workflow:\n\n1. **Dataset Selection**: Focus on datasets that include comprehensive protein interaction profiles, especially those with annotations on binding specificity versus non-specificity. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) with annotated complexes and training datasets from antibody-specific databases like SAbDab can be particularly useful.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**: Emphasize features that are predictive of binding specificity, such as interaction energy components, contact maps, and sequence motifs that are indicative of specific binding. We can use these features to guide the transfer learning process.\n\n3. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Apply transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models specifically on our nanobody dataset. This approach will allow the models to adapt existing knowledge to our specific context, improving their predictive accuracy for our targets.\n\n4. **Continuous Learning**: Implement a continuous learning framework where the model is periodically updated with new data obtained from ongoing experiments.

        "message": "Thank you. Here are my thoughts on focusing our enhanced sampling techniques to improve binding specificity:\n\n1. **Structural Features of Interest**: We should focus on sampling around key structural features such as the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the nanobodies. These regions are critical for binding specificity and affinity, and enhanced sampling can help us capture their conformational diversity and how mutations might alter their flexibility and binding interactions.\n\n2. **Energy Landscape Exploration**: Employ techniques like replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) to explore the energy landscape of nanobody-antigen interactions. Understanding the stability and transition states can provide insights into how different conformations contribute to specificity.\n\n3. **Hydrogen Bond Networks**: Investigate hydrogen bond networks within the interface. Enhanced sampling can identify transient hydrogen bonds that might contribute to specificity but are difficult to capture in static models.\n\n4. **Solvent Accessibility and Desolvation Effects**: Consider the impact of mutations on solvent accessibility and desolvation effects, as these can significantly influence binding specificity. Enhanced sampling can help model these effects more accurately.\n\n5. **Predicting Induced Fit Dynamics**: Use enhanced sampling to predict how nanobodies might undergo conformational changes upon binding\u2014a phenomenon known as induced fit. This can reveal how specific mutations facilitate or hinder this process, impacting specificity.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, enhanced sampling can provide a deeper understanding of the dynamic interactions that underpin specific binding, ultimately guiding us in designing nanobodies with greater precision and effectiveness against our target variants."

        "message": "Thank you. Here\u2019s my evaluation of how we can streamline our experimental validation process to efficiently identify and discard non-specific binders:\n\n1. **High-Throughput Screening**: Implement high-throughput screening methods early in the experimental phase to quickly assess binding specificity. Techniques such as phage display combined with deep sequencing can rapidly identify candidates with desired specificity profiles.\n\n2. **Competitive Binding Assays**: Use competitive binding assays where potential nanobodies must compete with known specific binders for the target epitope. This can help eliminate those with weaker or non-specific binding tendencies early on.\n\n3. **Biophysical Characterization**: Employ biophysical methods like surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or bio-layer interferometry (BLI) to quantify binding kinetics and affinities. These methods can discern subtle differences in binding specificity and provide detailed interaction profiles.\n\n4. **Iterative Refinement**: Establish a workflow where computational predictions are iteratively refined based on experimental feedback. This involves not just using experimental data to validate predictions but also updating computational models and parameters accordingly.\n\n5. **Parallel Validation**: Conduct parallel validation experiments with several potential off-targets, including BSA and other common contaminants. This will provide a comprehensive profile of specificity versus non-specificity.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, we can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our validation process, ensuring that non-specific binders are identified and excluded early, thereby streamlining the overall nanobody development process."

        "message": "Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).\n\nAs a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:\n\nH11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nNb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.\n\nTy1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.\n\nVHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.\n\nBased on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.\n\n\nAs a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?\n\n2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?\n\n3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?\n\n4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?\n\n5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?\n\n6. Will you use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or will you change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used?\n\n7. What computational pipeline will you use to design the 92 mutant nanobodies?\n\n8. How many mutations will you introduce in each nanobody?\n\n9. How will you avoid non-specific binding to BSA?\n\nYour summary should take the following form.\n\n### Agenda\n\nRestate the agenda in your own words.\n\n### Team Member Input\n\nSummarize all of the important points raised by each team member. This is to ensure that key details are preserved for future meetings.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nProvide your expert recommendation regarding the agenda.
