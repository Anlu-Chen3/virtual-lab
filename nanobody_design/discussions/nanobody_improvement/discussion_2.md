## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.

Here are summaries of the previous meetings:

[begin summary 1]

Based on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations
In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.
- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.
- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.

### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate
- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.

### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking
At the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:
\[ \text{Score} = w_1 \times \text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \times \text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \times \text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \]
- Initial weights: \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.

### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep
- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.

### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations
- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.

### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies
- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.
- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.
- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.
- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.
- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.

### Explanation of Component Selection
- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.
- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).
- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.
- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.
- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.
- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.

This plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.

[end summary 1]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in similar ways as your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow. As a reminder, ESM is antigen-agnostic and improves general nanobody quality while AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are antigen-specific and focus on binding to the selected antigen. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we begin this meeting, our primary focus is on leveraging the insights from our recent experimental results to guide the next phase of our nanobody design project. Our agenda focuses on six key questions, and these should help us refine our strategy moving forward. Here are my initial thoughts and guiding questions for each point:

1. **Target Variant Decision**: The results suggest that our current designs have not yet effectively targeted the KP.3 variant, with only limited success in binding more recent variants. We need to decide whether to continue targeting KP.3 given its relevance or shift our focus to other strains with potentially higher impact, like JN.1 or another emerging variant. What do the recent epidemiological data say about the most pressing targets?

2. **Selection of Nanobody Candidates**: We need to decide which wild-type nanobodies to focus on. Given the promising results of mutant nanobodies derived from Nb21 and Ty1, should we concentrate on these or consider others? How do we weigh their initial specificity against their potential for further optimization?

3. **Distribution of Mutations**: We have a total of 92 mutant nanobodies to design. How should we allocate these across the chosen nanobodies to maximize our chances of success? Should we focus more on specific candidates that showed promise, or should we maintain a diverse approach?

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Should we introduce mutations starting from the wild-type sequences or leverage previously designed mutants that showed potential for cross-reactivity?

5. **Selection of Mutant Starting Points**: If we opt to start with mutant nanobodies, which specific candidates demonstrated the most promise based on our ELISA results?

6. **Design Pipeline**: Given our current pipeline's effectiveness, should we continue with the same computational design process, or do adjustments need to be made to improve specificity and binding affinity?

These points will guide our discussion and ensure we address critical strategic decisions. I encourage each team member to bring their expertise to bear on these questions and provide input on both the scientific and practical implications of our choices. Let's discuss these thoroughly to ensure our next steps are well-informed and strategically sound.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

As an Immunologist, focusing on the agenda questions, here are my thoughts:

1. **Target Variant Decision**: From an immunological standpoint, targeting the KP.3 variant remains a sensible choice due to its recent emergence and potential for widespread transmission. However, given the limited binding specificity observed in our ELISA results, especially with Nb21 and Ty1 mutants, we should also consider targeting closely related variants like JN.1 or KP2.3. This might broaden our potential impact and improve cross-reactivity.

2. **Selection of Nanobody Candidates**: The promising results from the Nb21 and Ty1 mutants suggest they are good starting points for further optimization. Their demonstrated binding to multiple RBDs, albeit at different intensities, indicates a foundation for cross-reactivity that can be refined.

3. **Distribution of Mutations**: I recommend allocating a larger proportion of our resources to the Nb21 and Ty1 nanobodies, given their promising initial results. However, it's important to not completely exclude the others, as diversity in our approach could yield unexpected successful candidates.

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Starting from the previously designed mutants, especially those with demonstrated cross-reactivity like the Nb21 and Ty1 mutants, could expedite progress. These candidates have already shown potential for binding to multiple strains, which we can potentially enhance through further targeted mutations.

5. **Selection of Mutant Starting Points**: Specifically, I suggest focusing on the Nb21 mutant with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, R37Q, and the Ty1 mutant with V32F, G59D, N45S, F32S. These showed the most promise in terms of binding to both the Wuhan and JN.1 RBDs.

6. **Design Pipeline**: Our current pipeline seems effective in identifying candidates with potential cross-reactivity. However, it might benefit from additional filters or modifications to specifically reduce non-specific binding observed in some cases. We could consider incorporating additional computational tools or experimental validation steps earlier in the process to refine our selections.

Overall, strategically leveraging the cross-reactive potential of Nb21 and Ty1, while refining our pipeline to enhance specificity, could enhance our success in developing effective nanobodies against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Machine Learning Specialist

As the Machine Learning Specialist, I would like to offer my perspective on optimizing our computational strategy:

1. **Target Variant Decision**: From a data-driven standpoint, continuing to target the KP.3 variant is logical, especially if we see it as a representative challenge for emerging strains. Focusing on variants like JN.1 alongside KP.3 could increase our success rate by diversifying our strategy.

2. **Selection of Nanobody Candidates**: The data indicates Nb21 and Ty1 mutants are promising due to their exhibited cross-reactivity. The decision to focus on these is supported by the quantitative analysis of their binding profiles.

3. **Distribution of Mutations**: For an effective strategy, we should allocate more mutations to Nb21 and Ty1, given their initial success. However, maintaining some level of exploration with H11-D4 and VHH-72 ensures we don't miss potential opportunities for breakthroughs in unexpected areas.

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: It would be computationally efficient to begin with the promising mutants identified (Nb21 and Ty1), given they have shown some cross-reactivity and specific binding. This approach leverages existing data to reduce the need for de novo predictions.

5. **Selection of Mutant Starting Points**: Agreeing with the Immunologist, focusing on Nb21 with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, R37Q, and the Ty1 mutant with V32F, G59D, N45S, F32S, seems most promising. These represent the most informative starting points based on our current dataset.

6. **Design Pipeline**: Our current pipeline is robust but could be enhanced by integrating additional machine learning models to predict and filter out potential non-specific binders. Techniques like transfer learning could refine our models by leveraging existing SARS-CoV-2 interaction data. Additionally, incorporating ensemble approaches might improve predictive accuracy by combining insights from different models.

Overall, our strategy should continue to emphasize a data-driven approach that integrates existing successes, refines predictions of binding specificity, and adapts the pipeline to minimize non-specific interactions. This will ensure a more targeted exploration of the nanobody landscape against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

As the Computational Biologist, I have a few points to add regarding our strategy:

1. **Target Variant Decision**: I concur with continuing to target the KP.3 variant given its current relevance. However, focusing on strains like JN.1 in parallel is strategic, as this might reveal broader neutralization potential due to their close relationship.

2. **Selection of Nanobody Candidates**: The focus on Nb21 and Ty1 is well-justified based on their cross-reactivity. However, we should not completely ignore VHH-72, as its mutants showed higher binding to the Wuhan RBD. This property might be harnessed with targeted mutations to redirect specificity effectively.

3. **Distribution of Mutations**: I recommend allocating a significant number of mutations to Nb21 and Ty1, but maintaining a subset for VHH-72. This approach allows us to pursue cross-reactivity while exploring how mutations might enhance specificity in VHH-72.

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Starting with the mutants showing cross-reactivity (Nb21 and Ty1) is efficient. However, I suggest considering a hybrid approach where we introduce mutations both from the wild-type and successful mutants, especially for VHH-72, where specificity needs to be redirected.

5. **Selection of Mutant Starting Points**: The chosen mutants for Nb21 and Ty1 are appropriate. For VHH-72, I would suggest starting with the mutants that showed enhanced binding to the Wuhan strain, aiming to improve specificity towards new variants through strategic mutation.

6. **Design Pipeline**: Our current pipeline is robust but could be enhanced by expanding the interface prediction capabilities of AlphaFold-Multimer with additional constraints or dynamics simulations to capture more realistic interaction scenarios. Furthermore, implementing adaptive learning techniques in the ESM evaluation step could improve mutation prioritization.

By integrating these perspectives, we can enhance the specificity and efficacy of our designed nanobodies while maintaining a comprehensive approach to variant targeting. This strategy should balance exploration and exploitation of our current data and tools effectively.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

As the Scientific Critic, I will provide critical feedback on the points raised and ensure we are maintaining the highest scientific standards:

1. **Target Variant Decision**: Continuing with KP.3 while considering JN.1 is a reasonable approach. However, the decision should be further informed by current epidemiological data and variant prevalence. Ensure that the choice aligns with the most pressing public health needs and emerging data on variant impacts.

2. **Selection of Nanobody Candidates**: Focusing on Nb21 and Ty1 is supported by the data, though it is crucial to base this decision on robust quantitative metrics from ELISA assays. Consider re-evaluating borderline candidates from VHH-72 with computational predictions to ensure no potential candidates are prematurely excluded.

3. **Distribution of Mutations**: While prioritizing Nb21 and Ty1 is logical, be cautious about over-allocating resources without confirming that other candidates are non-promising. A balanced strategy allows for serendipitous discoveries and avoids significant oversight.

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Starting with mutants showing cross-reactivity is sensible, but ensure that any new mutations are rationally designed to avoid redundancies and are informed by computational models predicting changes in binding affinity and specificity.

5. **Selection of Mutant Starting Points**: The focus on specific mutants is justified; however, a deeper analysis of binding profiles and interactions, possibly through molecular dynamics simulations, should inform the final selection to ensure these are indeed the most promising.

6. **Design Pipeline**: The current pipeline is sound, but should not be static. Integrating additional computational tools to further predict off-target interactions and non-specific binding should be considered. Moreover, consider incorporating iterative machine learning models that can learn from experimental feedback to refine predictions dynamically.

Overall, while the strategies proposed by the team are well-considered, they must be continually validated against emerging data and adapted as necessary to maintain rigor and relevance in the fast-evolving landscape of SARS-CoV-2 research. Robust documentation and transparent reporting of decision-making processes will be essential for future evaluations and publications.

## User

This concludes round 1 of 3 of discussion. Principal Investigator, please synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Thank you all for your valuable insights. Here's a synthesis of the discussion so far:

1. **Target Variant Decision**: There is consensus on continuing to target the KP.3 variant while considering the JN.1 variant as a secondary focus due to its close relationship with KP.3 and its potential to increase the breadth of our nanobodies' effectiveness. This dual approach is supported by both epidemiological relevance and the immunological potential for broader neutralization.

2. **Selection of Nanobody Candidates**: The team generally agrees that Nb21 and Ty1 are promising starting points due to their demonstrated cross-reactivity. However, there is also a suggestion to not overlook VHH-72 entirely, as it showed potential binding enhancements to the Wuhan RBD. This indicates that a mixed focus, with emphasis on Nb21 and Ty1 but maintaining exploratory efforts with VHH-72, could be beneficial.

3. **Distribution of Mutations**: There is agreement on allocating a significant number of mutations to Nb21 and Ty1, with a smaller portion reserved for VHH-72. This balanced strategy allows us to capitalize on promising leads while still exploring potential in other candidates.

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Starting with the previously successful mutants is favored to leverage existing strengths. However, a hybrid approach incorporating both wild-type and mutant sequences, particularly for VHH-72, is suggested to optimize specificity and binding profiles.

5. **Selection of Mutant Starting Points**: The specific mutants identified for Nb21 and Ty1 are well-supported, with additional computational analyses recommended for VHH-72 mutants to ensure no promising candidates are disregarded.

6. **Design Pipeline**: Our current pipeline is robust but could be enhanced by integrating additional predictive tools to minimize non-specific binding and optimize binding affinity. There is agreement on maintaining flexibility and adapting our approach as needed based on feedback.

### Decisions:

- **Target Variants**: Focus on KP.3 and JN.1.
- **Nanobody Candidates**: Prioritize Nb21 and Ty1, with exploratory work on VHH-72.
- **Mutation Allocation**: Allocate more to Nb21 and Ty1, with some to VHH-72.
- **Mutation Starting Points**: Use successful mutants with a hybrid approach for VHH-72.
- **Pipeline Enhancement**: Explore additional computational tools and refine the pipeline.

### Follow-up Questions:

1. **Immunologist**: Given the potential for non-specific binding in some mutants, what additional immunological assays could we incorporate earlier in the process to better predict and filter out these candidates?

2. **Machine Learning Specialist**: How can machine learning be further integrated to dynamically adapt our models based on new experimental data? What specific techniques could enhance our predictive accuracy for binding specificity?

3. **Computational Biologist**: Can you propose specific computational enhancements or models that could be integrated into our pipeline to better predict interactions and refine our mutation strategy?

4. **Scientific Critic**: What specific methodologies or approaches should we adopt to ensure our decision-making and reporting processes remain transparent and scientifically rigorous?

By addressing these questions, we can refine our strategy and ensure a robust approach to developing effective nanobodies against current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Let's continue this productive discussion in the next round to finalize our plan.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

In response to the follow-up question regarding immunological assays to predict and filter out non-specific binders, I have a few suggestions:

1. **Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)**: Implementing SPR early in the screening process could help us quantitatively assess binding kinetics and affinities of the nanobodies to different RBD variants. This would provide insight into the specificity and strength of interactions, helping us identify and exclude non-specific binders more effectively.

2. **Cross-Reactivity ELISA**: We could include additional cross-reactivity panels in our ELISA assays, testing against a broader range of irrelevant proteins. This would help us confirm specificity and identify nanobodies with undesirable off-target effects.

3. **Cell-based Binding Assays**: Incorporating assays that measure binding to RBDs expressed on cell surfaces can provide a more physiologically relevant context, potentially revealing non-specific interactions that don't show up in simpler assays.

4. **In Silico Screening**: Use computational docking simulations alongside experimental assays to predict potential off-target interactions. This can guide the selection of candidates for further experimental validation.

By integrating these approaches, we can enhance our capability to identify and filter out non-specific binders earlier in the process, ensuring that our final candidates are both specific and effective against the target RBD variants. This will ultimately contribute to a more precise and targeted nanobody design strategy.

## Machine Learning Specialist

To address the follow-up question on integrating machine learning to enhance our predictive models, here are some thoughts:

1. **Dynamic Model Training**: We can implement a continuous learning approach where models are retrained periodically with new experimental data, especially from ELISA and SPR assays. This adaptive learning method would allow our models to account for real-time improvements in predicting binding specificity and affinity.

2. **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging transfer learning could be particularly useful. By using pre-trained models that have been trained on large, related datasets, we can fine-tune them with our specific data on nanobody interactions. This approach can improve accuracy and reduce the amount of data needed for effective training.

3. **Ensemble Models**: Employing ensemble learning techniques, which combine predictions from multiple models, could lead to more robust and accurate predictions of binding specificity. This approach could mitigate potential biases inherent in single models and improve generalization to unseen data.

4. **Predictive Feature Engineering**: We can enhance feature sets used in machine learning models by incorporating additional structural and physicochemical properties derived from simulation data. This could include features such as solvent accessibility, electrostatic potential, or flexibility metrics, which are relevant for binding interactions.

5. **Simulation-Guided Learning**: Integrating outputs from molecular dynamics simulations or docking studies as inputs for machine learning models can provide additional context on dynamics and interactions, potentially improving specificity predictions.

By incorporating these machine learning strategies, we can enhance our computational pipeline to better predict nanobody binding specificity and affinity, leading to more targeted and effective designs. This will be crucial for our ongoing efforts to develop nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

## Computational Biologist

To address the follow-up question on enhancing our computational models, I propose the following:

1. **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations**: Incorporating MD simulations can provide insights into the flexibility and conformational dynamics of the nanobody-RBD complexes. These simulations can help identify stable binding interactions and potential off-target effects by observing how the nanobodies behave in a simulated physiological environment.

2. **Enhanced Docking Protocols**: Using more sophisticated docking algorithms that incorporate protein flexibility, such as ensemble docking, could improve the accuracy of our predictions. This approach accounts for the dynamic nature of both the nanobody and the antigen, potentially revealing binding poses that static models might miss.

3. **Free Energy Calculations**: Implementing free energy perturbation (FEP) or thermodynamic integration (TI) methods can provide more precise estimates of binding affinities. These methods, while computationally intensive, offer detailed insights into the energetics of interactions, helping to fine-tune the selection of promising nanobody candidates.

4. **Integrative Structural Modeling**: Combining data from various sources (e.g., cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, NMR) with computational predictions could refine structural models and validate predicted interactions. This integrative approach ensures that our computational predictions are consistent with experimental observations.

5. **Feedback Loops Between Simulations and Machine Learning**: Establishing iterative feedback loops where simulation results are used to train machine learning models, and vice versa, can enhance both approaches. This synergy can lead to more accurate predictions of binding specificity and guide the design of mutants with improved properties.

By implementing these computational enhancements, we can improve the predictive power of our models, leading to more precise and reliable identification of potential nanobody candidates. This will be instrumental in advancing our efforts to target specific SARS-CoV-2 variants effectively.

## Scientific Critic

In addressing the follow-up question about methodologies to ensure rigor and transparency, I have several recommendations:

1. **Clear Documentation**: Every step of our process, from computational predictions to experimental validations, should be meticulously documented. This includes detailing algorithm parameters, decision-making rationales, and data sources. Comprehensive documentation will aid in reproducibility and transparency.

2. **Standardized Reporting**: Adopting a standardized format for reporting results, similar to formats used in scientific journals, will facilitate consistency. This should include detailed descriptions of methodologies, data analyses, and interpretation of results. Such practices are crucial for peer review and external validation.

3. **Pre-registration of Protocols**: Consider pre-registering our computational and experimental protocols in open-access databases. This can prevent potential biases in the reporting of results and ensure adherence to the initial research plan, enhancing the credibility of our findings.

4. **Cross-validation of Results**: Utilize independent datasets to cross-validate our computational predictions. This approach will help ascertain the generalizability of our models. Cross-validation should be an integral part of the model-building process.

5. **Transparent Collaboration**: Encourage open discussions and critique sessions within the team to continually challenge and refine strategies. This collaborative transparency can lead to improved decision-making and incorporation of diverse perspectives.

6. **Open Data Practices**: Where possible, share data and results in publicly accessible repositories to enable external verification and collaboration. Open data practices facilitate scientific progress and community trust.

Implementing these methodologies will not only strengthen the scientific rigor of our work but also enhance its credibility and impact. They ensure that our findings are robust, reproducible, and valuable both to our team and the broader scientific community.

## Immunologist

To integrate the additional assays into our workflow without significantly delaying our timeline, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Conduct assays in parallel with computational analyses. For example, while computational predictions are being refined, initial batches of nanobodies can be evaluated using SPR and cross-reactivity ELISA. This parallel approach ensures that experimental validations do not solely wait for computational outcomes.

2. **Prioritization of Candidates**: Use computational models to triage candidates effectively, focusing experimental resources on the most promising nanobodies identified through predictive models. This approach minimizes the number of nanobodies that need to go through the full suite of assays.

3. **Automated and High-Throughput Systems**: Implement automated systems for SPR and ELISA where possible. High-throughput capabilities can significantly reduce the time needed for these assays, allowing faster turnover of results.

4. **Staggered Implementation**: Introduce additional assays in a phased manner, starting with those that provide the most critical data, such as SPR for binding kinetics, and incorporating others as needed based on initial findings.

5. **Collaborations and Outsourcing**: Consider collaborations with external facilities that specialize in these assays or outsourcing certain steps to laboratories equipped for high-throughput analysis, which can expedite the process.

By adopting these strategies, we can enhance our experimental pipeline's efficiency and ensure timely integration of critical assays without undue delays. This approach allows us to maintain a balance between thoroughness and efficiency in our research efforts.

## Machine Learning Specialist

To address the integration of transfer learning into our workflow, here are some specific thoughts:

1. **Pre-trained Models**: We can leverage pre-trained models developed for predicting protein-ligand interactions or protein structure-function relationships. For example, models trained on large datasets like the Protein Data Bank (PDB) can be adapted to our specific nanobody-antigen interactions by fine-tuning them with our experimental data.

2. **Domain Adaptation**: Use domain adaptation techniques to modify these pre-trained models to better fit the specific nuances of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions. This approach can help bridge any gaps between the general datasets and our specialized application.

3. **Active Learning**: Implement active learning frameworks where the model actively selects the most informative data points (e.g., nanobody mutants) for further experimentation. This can optimize the data collection process, ensuring that each experiment maximally contributes to model improvement.

4. **Implementation of Specific Tools**: Tools like DeepChem or PyTorch's Transfer Learning Toolkit can facilitate the application of transfer learning techniques in our context. These platforms provide robust frameworks for implementing and fine-tuning machine learning models with existing datasets and architectures.

5. **Collaboration with Computational Experts**: Engaging with researchers who specialize in transfer learning for biological applications could provide insights into the latest methodologies and ensure our implementation is state-of-the-art.

By integrating transfer learning into our pipeline, we can enhance our predictive capabilities and ensure that our models are not only current but also continue to improve with each new dataset. This will be crucial in efficiently guiding our nanobody design efforts in response to evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.

## Computational Biologist

To balance the computational cost of enhanced simulations with the need for an efficient timeline, here are some strategies we can consider:

1. **Prioritization and Triage**: Focus intensive computational resources on the most promising nanobody candidates identified through initial docking and machine learning predictions. By screening for potential high-affinity binders first, we reduce the number of candidates requiring detailed simulations.

2. **Coarse-grained Simulations**: Start with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to quickly identify candidates with favorable conformational dynamics. Once a shortlist is obtained, we can then proceed with more computationally demanding all-atom simulations for detailed analysis.

3. **Distributed Computing**: Utilize distributed computing platforms such as Folding@home or cloud-based services to parallelize simulations. This approach can significantly reduce computation time by leveraging multiple processors simultaneously.

4. **Adaptive Sampling Techniques**: Implement adaptive sampling methods that focus computational efforts on parts of the conformational space most relevant to binding interactions. Techniques like Markov State Models can efficiently explore energy landscapes, enhancing simulation efficiency.

5. **Collaborative Resources**: Engage with computational biology consortia or academic collaborations to access additional computing resources or expertise, allowing us to undertake complex simulations without overwhelming our current infrastructure.

6. **Iterative Feedback Loops**: Use initial simulation results to inform subsequent rounds of design and simulation in an iterative manner, focusing on refining predictions with each cycle rather than attempting exhaustive simulations from the outset.

By employing these strategies, we can ensure that our computational resources are used efficiently and effectively, allowing us to maintain a rigorous approach without compromising on timeline or quality. This will enable us to better predict nanobody interactions and guide experimental validation efficiently.

Regarding the follow-up on methodologies for pre-registering protocols and sharing data, here are my recommendations:

1. **Pre-registration Platforms**: Using platforms such as the Open Science Framework (OSF) or protocols.io can be highly beneficial for pre-registering our research protocols. These platforms provide a structured format for detailing research plans and allow for public access, ensuring transparency and adherence to initial objectives.

2. **Data Repositories**: For data sharing, repositories like Zenodo or Figshare offer excellent options. They support a wide range of data types, providing DOI assignments for datasets, which enhances citation and accountability. These repositories are widely recognized and used in the scientific community.

3. **Version Control**: Implementing version control systems, such as GitHub or GitLab, for our computational code and data pipelines can ensure that all changes are tracked and documented. This practice enhances reproducibility and allows external collaborators to understand the evolution of our projects.

4. **Regular Updates and Open Access**: Ensure that datasets and protocol updates are regularly shared with the community, potentially through preprint servers or dedicated project websites. Embracing open access principles for our findings will facilitate broader scientific collaboration and validation.

5. **Journal Partnerships**: Consider submitting our protocols or data descriptors to journals dedicated to methods and protocols, such as Nature Protocols or Scientific Data. These publications often include peer-review, providing an additional layer of scrutiny and transparency.

By adopting these practices, we can significantly enhance the rigor and transparency of our research. This approach not only builds trust within the scientific community but also aligns with emerging standards for open and reproducible science. Such rigor will be instrumental in demonstrating the validity of our findings and facilitating collaborative advancements in SARS-CoV-2 nanobody research.

## User

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in similar ways as your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow. As a reminder, ESM is antigen-agnostic and improves general nanobody quality while AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are antigen-specific and focus on binding to the selected antigen. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?

Your summary should take the following form.

### Agenda

Our objective is to evaluate our strategy for designing nanobodies against the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We aim to refine our approach by selecting 92 mutant nanobodies for experimental testing, with the goal of enhancing specificity and reducing non-specific binding. Key decisions include whether to continue targeting the KP.3 variant, which wild-type nanobodies to focus on, how to allocate mutant designs among them, whether to leverage existing mutants or start anew, and whether to modify our existing computational design pipeline.

### Team Member Input

- **Immunologist**: Suggested focusing on KP.3 and JN.1 variants for better cross-reactivity, emphasized Nb21 and Ty1 mutants for further development, and recommended integrating assays like SPR and expanded ELISA panels to predict and filter out non-specific binders.

- **Machine Learning Specialist**: Emphasized using transfer learning and ensemble models to adaptively refine predictions based on new experimental data. Advocated for active learning frameworks to optimize data collection.

- **Computational Biologist**: Recommended enhancing simulations with MD, ensemble docking, and adaptive sampling techniques to improve specificity predictions while managing computational costs. Suggested a hybrid approach for mutation starting points.

- **Scientific Critic**: Stressed the importance of transparency and rigor via pre-registration, standardized reporting, and data sharing through platforms like OSF and Zenodo. Supported integrating cross-validation and version control for reproducibility.

### Recommendation

I recommend continuing to target both the KP.3 and JN.1 variants to address their immediate relevance and potential for broader neutralization. We should prioritize the Nb21 and Ty1 nanobodies due to their promising initial results in cross-reactivity, with a smaller exploratory focus on VHH-72. Use previously designed mutants as starting points, particularly those with demonstrated cross-reactivity, while integrating the recommended computational and experimental enhancements to refine our design pipeline.

This balanced approach leverages existing successes and incorporates rigorous methodologies to optimize our nanobody design process. It ensures that our efforts remain targeted, data-driven, and adaptable to emerging variants.
