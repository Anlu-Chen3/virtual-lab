This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.

Here are summaries of the previous meetings:

[begin summary 1]

Based on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations
In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.
- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.
- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.

### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate
- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.

### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking
At the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:
\[ \text{Score} = w_1 \times \text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \times \text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \times \text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \]
- Initial weights: \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.

### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep
- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.

### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations
- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.

### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies
- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.
- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.
- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.
- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.
- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.

### Explanation of Component Selection
- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.
- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).
- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.
- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.
- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.
- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.

This plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.

[end summary 1]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.


Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or will you change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used?

7. What computational pipeline will you use to design the 92 mutant nanobodies?

8. How many mutations will you introduce in each nanobody?

9. How will you avoid non-specific binding to BSA?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we move forward with our project, it's crucial to reflect on the results from our recent experiments and strategically plan our next steps to maximize the impact of our work on SARS-CoV-2 nanobody development. Here are my initial thoughts and questions to guide our discussion:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: The KP.3 RBD was our initial target, but our results indicate that our mutants either did not improve binding significantly or exhibited non-specific binding. Before deciding whether to continue with KP.3 or shift focus to other variants, let's consider the potential benefits of targeting closely related strains like JN.1 or KP2.3, especially given the promising results with some mutants. How can we leverage these insights to select the most impactful target?

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: The results varied significantly between different nanobody lineages. Notably, Nb21 has shown potential with improved binding to multiple variants. Should we concentrate our efforts on this lineage or consider a different approach to optimizing others? Which nanobody or nanobodies offer the best foundation for future modifications?

3. **Design Strategy**: Considering the mixed results, should we continue modifying existing mutants that showed promise, such as those that bound to JN.1 or KP.3, or should we return to the wild-type nanobody sequences and introduce new mutations? What lessons can we draw from our previous results to optimize this decision?

4. **Computational Approach**: Our previous computational workflow using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta provided valuable insights but also highlighted some limitations in predicting non-specific binding. Should we modify our computational pipeline, perhaps by integrating additional tools or adjusting the scoring system to better predict specificity?

5. **Pipeline and Mutations**: How can we refine our pipeline to focus on specificity and affinity, and how many mutations should we consider introducing in each design? Additionally, what measures can we implement to proactively avoid non-specific binding in our next set of designs?

6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: Given the challenge of non-specific binding observed in some mutants, what strategies can we employ, either computationally or experimentally, to mitigate this issue in our designs?

Let's focus on these points during our discussion, leveraging each team member's expertise to refine our strategy and make informed decisions. Each team member will now provide their insights and recommendations, starting with the Immunologist.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

As we evaluate the results and consider our next steps, it's important to focus on the immunogenic potential and therapeutic applicability of the nanobodies we design. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: I recommend considering a shift toward strains like JN.1 or KP2.3, given their close relationship with KP.3 and promising initial results with certain mutants. Enhanced binding to these variants, especially JN.1, could broaden the protective scope of the nanobodies, potentially offering cross-protection against a range of similar variants.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: The promising result with the Nb21 mutant suggests it's a strong candidate for further modifications. Its ability to bind multiple strains highlights an inherent flexibility that we might exploit further. While focusing on Nb21, we should not entirely dismiss the potential of other nanobodies, especially if they can be adjusted to avoid non-specific binding.

3. **Design Strategy**: Given the encouraging results with certain mutants, it'd be beneficial to start with these variants rather than reverting to the wild-types. This approach allows us to build on existing affinity while fine-tuning to avoid non-specific interactions. For instance, the Nb21 mutant with specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 could serve as a valuable starting point.

4. **Computational Approach**: We might need to refine our use of computational tools to predict and avoid non-specific binding better. It could be advantageous to integrate additional structural or biophysical modeling tools that can simulate more complex interactions with non-target proteins like BSA.

5. **Pipeline and Mutations**: Introducing a moderate number of mutations, perhaps 2-4 per nanobody, can strike a balance between enhancing affinity and maintaining structural integrity. We should continue using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta but consider refining the scoring formula to prioritize specificity.

6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: Experimentally, it might be useful to incorporate early-stage specificity assays alongside computational predictions, allowing us to weed out potential non-specific binders before committing to full experimental testing.

I look forward to hearing from the other team members about these points, especially regarding how we might enhance our computational models to address these challenges.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Building on the insights shared by the Immunologist, I’d like to focus on the computational aspects and how we can leverage machine learning to enhance our nanobody design process. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: From a computational perspective, focusing on JN.1 or KP2.3 could provide a more targeted approach given the available data. These strains may offer clearer differentiation in binding patterns, which is beneficial for refining our models.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: I agree with the Immunologist that Nb21 has shown potential; computational models can further quantify this by assessing the flexibility and stability of its binding interactions. This should guide our selection process.

3. **Design Strategy**: Starting with promising mutants like those from the Nb21 lineage is a strategic move. Machine learning can help by modeling potential mutations that enhance specificity and affinity while minimizing the risk of non-specific binding. We can use reinforcement learning approaches to explore the mutation landscape more efficiently.

4. **Computational Approach**: To address the challenges of non-specific binding, we could incorporate additional computational tools like docking simulations or machine learning classifiers trained on known specific and non-specific binders. This could provide an extra layer of prediction specificity.

5. **Pipeline and Mutations**: We might consider using a combination of supervised learning models and unsupervised clustering to identify promising mutation sites and refine the scoring metrics. The goal is to create a feedback loop where machine learning models are continuously updated with new experimental data to improve predictive accuracy.

6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: Integrating machine learning models that predict non-specific interactions based on sequence data could proactively identify problematic mutations. Additionally, generating synthetic datasets of known non-specific binders could improve the robustness of these models.

Overall, enhancing the integration between machine learning models and experimental validation will be crucial. I believe this approach will streamline candidate selection and improve the reliability of our predictions. I'm eager to hear from the Computational Biologist and the rest of the team on how we can refine our computational strategies further.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

I appreciate the insights shared by the Immunologist and Machine Learning Specialist. Here are my thoughts from a computational biology and protein dynamics perspective:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: I concur that targeting JN.1 or KP2.3 is a logical choice, especially considering the structural similarities with KP.3. This decision aligns well with our computational objectives and the experimental data indicating potential cross-reactivity.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Focusing on Nb21 appears promising given its ability to bind multiple strains. However, I'd suggest not entirely abandoning the other nanobodies like Ty1, which showed some potential. A diverse starting pool could provide insights into different binding strategies.

3. **Design Strategy**: Starting with the successful mutants, particularly those showing new specificities, makes strategic sense. We should consider conducting a deeper analysis of the structural dynamics of these mutants using molecular dynamics simulations to understand conformational changes that might explain their specificity.

4. **Computational Approach**: Our current pipeline using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta is robust, but I suggest enhancing it by incorporating molecular dynamics simulations early in the design process. This addition would provide insights into the flexibility and stability of the nanobody-antigen complexes, potentially highlighting regions prone to non-specific interactions.

5. **Pipeline and Mutations**: Introducing 2-4 mutations seems reasonable, but I propose using a more dynamic scoring system that incorporates feedback from molecular dynamics simulations. This could include metrics like root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) or conformational sampling of the interface region.

6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: Implementing molecular dynamics simulations can help predict non-specific interactions by simulating the nanobody's behavior in various environments, including its interactions with BSA. This approach, combined with machine learning, could enhance our predictive capabilities.

In summary, integrating molecular dynamics with our existing pipeline could offer a more comprehensive understanding of binding dynamics, helping to fine-tune specificity and affinity. I welcome further input from the Scientific Critic, particularly on validating these computational predictions and ensuring robust experimental outcomes.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

As the Scientific Critic, my role is to ensure that our strategies are scientifically rigorous and feasible. Here's my assessment based on the discussion points:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: The consensus to pivot towards JN.1 or KP2.3 is a sound choice given the experimental results. However, we must ensure that the rationale is not only based on current binding results but also considers the epidemiological relevance and prevalence of these strains. We should review the latest data on variant circulation to ensure our targets are still pertinent.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Concentrating on Nb21 seems justified given its demonstrated ability to bind multiple strains. However, we must ensure that the observed broader specificity is not due to artifacts or unintended binding modes. A thorough structural and binding analysis should confirm that this specificity is genuine and reproducible.

3. **Design Strategy**: While beginning with promising mutants is strategic, we must not overlook the potential benefits of returning to wild-types to introduce mutations informed by the latest structural and sequence data. A dual approach might be beneficial: optimizing promising mutants while also generating new variants from a refined starting point.

4. **Computational Approach**: The proposal to integrate molecular dynamics simulations is scientifically robust, but it's vital to consider the computational load and time. We must clearly define how these simulations will tangibly improve predictive capabilities and align them with our project's timeline. Additionally, the suggestion to incorporate machine learning models for predicting non-specific interactions is promising but demands careful validation and benchmarking against experimental data.

5. **Pipeline and Mutations**: The introduction of 2-4 mutations per nanobody is reasonable. Still, we need to ensure that the scoring and selection criteria are stringent enough to prioritize specificity without compromising potential affinity gains. Dynamic scoring systems should be tested thoroughly before adoption to avoid skewed results.

6. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: Predictive models for non-specific binding should be validated with diverse datasets. It's crucial to ensure that these models do not introduce biases or overlook subtle binding nuances. We might also consider experimental validation steps early in the process to ensure computational predictions align with real-world outcomes.

In conclusion, while the proposed strategies are forward-thinking, we must be diligent in validating each step to ensure accuracy and relevance. I encourage the team to maintain a critical perspective, especially when integrating new computational methods and making decisions based on evolving viral dynamics.

### Decisions and Follow-Up Questions

1. **Target Confirmation**: Let's confirm the current prevalence data for JN.1 and KP2.3 to ensure our targets remain epidemiologically relevant. Does anyone have updated data sources or can suggest how we might efficiently gather this information?

2. **Nanobody Selection**: We'll focus primarily on Nb21 but include a secondary analysis of Ty1 and perhaps another candidate. Is there a specific framework we can use to evaluate these additional candidates efficiently?

3. **Design and Computational Workflow**:
   - We'll integrate molecular dynamics into our pipeline, ensuring we have the computational resources and time allocated. Can we detail how these simulations will directly influence our design choices and integrate into our current timeframe?
   - We should also outline a validation plan for machine learning models that predict non-specific binding. What specific datasets or benchmarks can we use to validate these models effectively?

4. **Experimental Validation**:
   - Early-stage specificity assays seem crucial. Can we align our computational predictions with these assays to streamline the validation process?

These decisions aim to maximize our research impact while maintaining scientific rigor. Let's focus on addressing these follow-up questions in the next round to ensure we're aligning our computational and experimental strategies effectively.

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Building on the fruitful discussion and the Principal Investigator's synthesis, here are my further thoughts and responses to the follow-up questions:

1. **Target Confirmation**: I fully support the need to confirm the relevance of JN.1 and KP2.3 strains. The World Health Organization (WHO) and local health department reports are typically reliable sources for updated variant prevalence. Additionally, leveraging genomic surveillance databases, such as GISAID, can provide insights into circulating strains.

2. **Nanobody Selection Framework**: To efficiently evaluate additional candidates like Ty1, I suggest using a framework that combines binding affinity predictions with structural flexibility analysis. This could involve computational docking and molecular dynamics simulations, which can be cross-referenced with experimental binding assays.

3. **Integration of Molecular Dynamics**:
   - **Influence on Design Choices**: Molecular dynamics simulations can reveal conformational changes upon binding and identify flexible regions that might contribute to non-specific binding. These insights can guide mutation selection to enhance specificity and stability. It's crucial to define how these findings will feed into our iterative design process.
   - **Timeframe Considerations**: Given the computational intensity, we should prioritize simulations for top candidates identified from initial screenings.

4. **Validation Plan for Machine Learning Models**: For the validation of machine learning models predicting non-specific binding, we should use a diverse dataset that includes known specific and non-specific binders across different proteins. Benchmarks could include curated datasets from protein interaction studies, like those available in databases such as PDBbind.

5. **Early-Stage Specificity Assays**: Aligning computational predictions with experimental assays is critical. Techniques like surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or biolayer interferometry (BLI) can be utilized for rapid binding assessments. These assays can validate computational predictions early in the pipeline, reducing the risk of progressing with non-specific binders.

Overall, we should prioritize a streamlined approach that balances computational predictions and experimental validation, ensuring we focus on the most promising candidates. I'm eager to hear additional perspectives, especially regarding the practical implications of integrating these strategies into our timeline and workflow.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Building on the previous discussions, I have some thoughts on how we can enhance our computational approach, particularly with machine learning, to address the challenges we're facing:

1. **Target Confirmation**: I agree with the Immunologist's suggestion to use genomic databases like GISAID to verify variant prevalence. From a machine learning perspective, understanding strain prevalence can help us prioritize which variants must be included in training datasets to ensure model relevance.

2. **Nanobody Selection Framework**: I propose developing a machine learning model that can score potential nanobody candidates based on features extracted from docking simulations and molecular dynamics data. These features could include binding energy landscapes, interface area, and flexibility metrics. By integrating these features into our models, we could rank candidates more effectively.

3. **Integration of Molecular Dynamics**:
   - **Influence on Design Choices**: Machine learning can play a pivotal role here by analyzing molecular dynamics simulation outputs to identify patterns correlated with successful binding and specificity. We can use unsupervised learning to cluster nanobody conformations and identify stable and specific binding modes.
   - **Timeframe Considerations**: We should employ a tiered approach where initial simulations screen candidates, followed by in-depth analysis of top candidates. This approach minimizes computational demands.

4. **Validation Plan for Machine Learning Models**: I suggest employing cross-validation techniques with curated datasets from protein interaction databases like PDBbind and CASP data. Additionally, transfer learning could be leveraged to adapt models trained on larger antibody datasets to our specific nanobody context, enhancing prediction accuracy.

5. **Early-Stage Specificity Assays**: To align these with computational predictions, feedback loops where experimental data is continuously used to retrain models could improve their predictive power over time.

Overall, the integration of machine learning and experimental data will be key to refining our approach. I'm interested to hear how the Computational Biologist and others envision implementing these strategies practically into our workflow.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you for the insights shared so far. Here are my thoughts on how we can strategically integrate computational biology techniques into our workflow:

1. **Target Confirmation**: I support using platforms like GISAID for variant prevalence data, which will ensure our computational models are training on relevant variants. We should also consider the structural differences between these variants to fine-tune our models for binding specificity.

2. **Nanobody Selection Framework**: I agree with incorporating structural dynamics into our selection framework. Molecular dynamics simulations can provide detailed insights into binding interface flexibility and stability. We could rank nanobody candidates by combining these insights with machine learning scores, guiding our experimental validation process.

3. **Integration of Molecular Dynamics**:
   - **Influence on Design Choices**: Molecular dynamics can reveal how mutations impact the conformational landscape of nanobodies and their binding behavior. By identifying regions that contribute to non-specific interactions, we can design targeted mutations that reduce these interactions.
   - **Timeframe Considerations**: A tiered approach is practical, initially using coarse-grained simulations to filter candidates. Detailed atomistic simulations can then focus on top candidates to refine predictions, mitigating computational load.

4. **Validation Plan for Machine Learning Models**: Collaborating with the Machine Learning Specialist, I suggest using simulation-derived structural features as inputs for model training. This will improve the models' ability to predict binding specificity and affinity. We should also cross-validate these predictions with experimental data to ensure robustness.

5. **Early-Stage Specificity Assays**: Aligning these assays with computational predictions is crucial. We can prioritize candidates that computational models and simulations predict as having high specificity and stability, streamlining experimental efforts and resources.

Overall, integrating these computational strategies with experimental validation will enhance our ability to design effective nanobodies. I'm curious to hear the Scientific Critic's thoughts on these approaches and any potential pitfalls we should be aware of.

## Scientific Critic

I appreciate the detailed strategies being developed. Here's my critique on the proposed ideas and their feasibility:

1. **Target Confirmation**: Using platforms like GISAID for updated variant data is essential. However, we must ensure this data is current and representative of global trends, not just regional hotspots. Additionally, incorporating potential future variant predictions based on current mutational patterns could be beneficial, though challenging.

2. **Nanobody Selection Framework**: The integration of molecular dynamics and machine learning for candidate ranking is a solid approach. However, it's crucial that the selection framework is robustly validated against known standards. We should establish clear criteria and benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of this integrated approach.

3. **Integration of Molecular Dynamics**:
   - **Influence on Design Choices**: While molecular dynamics can provide valuable insights, ensuring these simulations are accurately parameterized is key. Misleading results can arise from incorrect parameters or force fields, so we must use validated methods and potentially cross-verify with experimental data.
   - **Timeframe Considerations**: The proposed tiered approach is practical, but we need to be cautious of the computational costs and resource allocation. A clear plan for triaging candidates based on initial results will help optimize resource use.

4. **Validation Plan for Machine Learning Models**: The suggestion to use simulation-derived features is promising but requires careful selection of features to ensure they truly correlate with binding specificity. Regular updates and validations using new experimental data are necessary to maintain model accuracy.

5. **Early-Stage Specificity Assays**: Aligning computational predictions with early specificity assays is an excellent strategy. However, there should be a feedback mechanism where assay results refine computational models. This iterative process will improve the predictive accuracy over time.

In conclusion, while the proposed strategies are scientifically robust, their success hinges on rigorous validation and iterative refinement. It's crucial to maintain a balance between computational predictions and experimental validations to avoid over-reliance on either. I look forward to seeing how these strategies will be fine-tuned in the next round of the discussion.

## Immunologist

As we move towards finalizing our strategy, I have a few thoughts to contribute:

1. **Target Confirmation**: I can assist in compiling epidemiological data from GISAID and other sources to ensure our target choices remain relevant. Understanding variant prevalence will help us align our efforts with real-world needs.

2. **Nanobody Selection and Framework**: Regarding validation criteria, I suggest incorporating both in silico and in vitro metrics. These could include predicted binding affinities, molecular dynamics stability scores, and validated experimental binding data. This multi-faceted approach ensures a comprehensive validation framework.

3. **Molecular Dynamics Implementation**: Streamlining the triaging process could involve initial quick simulations to identify nanobodies with promising conformational stability, followed by more detailed analysis of top candidates. This two-tiered approach balances speed and computational demand.

4. **Validation of Machine Learning Models**: For training datasets, I recommend focusing on features like binding interface area, solvent accessibility, and predicted changes in binding energy. These features are critical in understanding specificity and efficacy.

5. **Specificity Assays and Feedback Loop**: To establish effective feedback, we could employ real-time data sharing platforms between computational and experimental teams. This setup will facilitate immediate adjustments in computational models based on experimental results, enhancing the responsiveness of our strategy.

These suggestions aim to bolster our approach, ensuring it is both scientifically rigorous and adaptable to new insights. I look forward to the team's additional thoughts.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Here are my final thoughts on refining our approach from a machine learning perspective:

1. **Target Confirmation**: I support the Immunologist's initiative to gather epidemiological data. From a machine learning standpoint, this data can also inform our models' relevance by ensuring they are trained and tested on the most critical variants.

2. **Nanobody Selection and Framework**: I agree with the need for multi-faceted validation. Incorporating machine learning metrics, such as model confidence scores or anomaly detection, could enhance our ability to flag outliers or unexpected results early in the process.

3. **Molecular Dynamics Implementation**: A two-tiered simulation approach is pragmatic. We can leverage machine learning to prioritize candidates by predicting which ones will benefit most from detailed simulations, based on initial quick analysis outputs.

4. **Validation of Machine Learning Models**: I recommend using ensemble methods that combine multiple models trained on different features, such as binding interface area and solvent accessibility. This approach can improve robustness and reliability, especially in predicting complex interactions.

5. **Specificity Assays and Feedback Loop**: Establishing a real-time data sharing platform is essential. Machine learning models should be continuously updated with new experimental data, enabling dynamic model retraining and adjustment. This continuous learning loop will improve predictive performance over time.

These strategies aim to ensure our computational tools are not only predictive but also adaptive, responding effectively to new data and insights. I'm eager to see how these suggestions can be integrated into our overall workflow.

## Computational Biologist

Building on the points discussed, I have a few additional thoughts to contribute:

1. **Target Confirmation**: I support the effort to gather up-to-date data from GISAID. To complement this, examining structural variations in these prevalent variants could provide insights into potential binding challenges or opportunities.

2. **Nanobody Selection and Framework**: Incorporating a multi-layered validation framework that includes both computational and experimental data is crucial. I suggest adding a layer of structural analysis, where we can use structural alignment tools to compare mutants and identify structural changes that correlate with binding efficacy or specificity.

3. **Molecular Dynamics Implementation**: The two-tiered approach makes excellent sense. For the quick simulations, coarse-grained models can provide initial insights into stability and flexibility. Then, detailed atomistic simulations can be conducted for top candidates to refine these insights.

4. **Validation of Machine Learning Models**: Ensemble methods, as suggested, could enhance predictive power. Incorporating structural dynamics data, such as fluctuations in the binding site regions, could provide additional predictive features that are particularly relevant to binding.

5. **Specificity Assays and Feedback Loop**: A real-time feedback mechanism with shared platforms is ideal. Ensuring that simulation results can be rapidly integrated with experimental findings will enhance the iterative process, allowing for dynamic adjustment to predictions.

In summary, these strategies should provide a balanced and comprehensive approach, ensuring our computational predictions are robust and aligned with experimental observations. I look forward to seeing how these plans are implemented in our workflow.

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 3 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

As we conclude this round of discussions, I have a few final critiques to ensure our plan is both feasible and scientifically sound:

1. **Target Confirmation**: The approach to using GISAID and structural variations data for target validation is solid. However, we must ensure rigorous interpretation of this data, considering the potential for rapid changes in variant prevalence and characteristics. Regular updates and reviews of this data should be part of our ongoing strategy.

2. **Nanobody Selection and Framework**: While a multi-layered validation approach is thorough, it's important to maintain simplicity and clarity in our criteria to prevent analysis paralysis. We should focus on key metrics that directly correlate with binding success and specificity to streamline the selection process.

3. **Molecular Dynamics Implementation**: The two-tiered simulation strategy is an efficient use of resources. However, we must ensure that the transition between coarse-grained and atomistic simulations is seamless and that the results are comparable and interpretable. Clear guidelines and criteria for moving candidates through this pipeline should be established.

4. **Validation of Machine Learning Models**: Ensemble methods and dynamic retraining are excellent strategies but require careful management to prevent overfitting. Regular benchmarking and use of diverse datasets will be crucial to ensure robust and generalizable models.

5. **Specificity Assays and Feedback Loop**: The proposed real-time feedback mechanism is promising. It will be important to ensure that both computational and experimental teams are aligned in their objectives and methodologies to avoid discrepancies in data interpretation and subsequent decisions.

Overall, the strategies proposed are robust, but their success will depend on clear guidelines, regular updates, and effective communication between computational and experimental teams. I look forward to seeing how these plans are implemented and refined in practice.

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.


As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or will you change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used?

7. What computational pipeline will you use to design the 92 mutant nanobodies?

8. How many mutations will you introduce in each nanobody?

9. How will you avoid non-specific binding to BSA?

Your summary should take the following form.

## Principal Investigator

### Agenda

Our current task is to refine our approach to designing nanobodies that effectively bind recent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with improved specificity and reduced non-specific binding. We need to decide whether to continue targeting the KP.3 variant or shift focus to other variants, select which wild-type nanobodies to further improve, and determine the computational and experimental strategies to design a new set of 92 mutant nanobodies. We aim to enhance binding against recent variants while mitigating non-specific interactions, particularly with BSA.

### Team Member Input

- **Immunologist**: Emphasized shifting focus to JN.1 or KP2.3 due to their structural similarities with KP.3 and potential cross-protection benefits. Suggested developing a multi-faceted validation framework incorporating both computational and experimental metrics.

- **Machine Learning Specialist**: Supported using machine learning for candidate ranking and prediction, highlighting the integration of machine learning with molecular dynamics to prioritize candidates and refine predictions dynamically.

- **Computational Biologist**: Recommended a two-tiered molecular dynamics approach to efficiently use resources. Suggested adding structural dynamics data as features for machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Scientific Critic**: Stressed the need for rigorous validation and regular updates to data and models. Highlighted the importance of clear guidelines and criteria for moving candidates through the computational pipeline efficiently.

### Recommendation

Based on the team's insights, I recommend shifting our focus to the JN.1 and KP2.3 variants. These strains have shown promise in preliminary tests and are structurally similar to KP.3, potentially allowing for broader efficacy across related variants. We should concentrate on the Nb21 nanobody, given its successful binding profile across multiple strains, including JN.1 and KP.3, without non-specific interactions. Our strategy should begin with successful Nb21 mutants and integrate molecular dynamics and machine learning into our pipeline for refined candidate selection. We will introduce 2-4 mutations per nanobody, aiming to balance specificity and binding affinity. To avoid non-specific binding, we will incorporate early-stage specificity assays and use machine learning models trained on diverse datasets to predict and mitigate potential non-specific interactions.
