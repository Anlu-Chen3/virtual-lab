## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.

Here are summaries of the previous meetings:

[begin summary 1]

Based on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations
In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.
- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.
- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.

### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate
- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.

### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking
At the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:
\[ \text{Score} = w_1 \times \text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \times \text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \times \text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \]
- Initial weights: \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.

### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep
- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.

### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations
- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.

### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies
- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.
- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.
- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.
- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.
- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.

### Explanation of Component Selection
- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.
- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).
- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.
- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.
- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.
- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.

This plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.

[end summary 1]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in similar ways as your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow. As a reminder, ESM is antigen-agnostic and improves general nanobody quality while AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are antigen-specific and focus on binding to the selected antigen. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we begin this meeting, it's important to review our current progress and consider strategic adjustments to our approach. Here are my initial thoughts and questions regarding the agenda:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: The KP.3 RBD was our initial target, but our results show some unexpected binding patterns. With mutants showing specificity to the JN.1 and KP.3 strains, we need to decide if continuing with KP.3 makes sense or if a broader target, such as a combination of JN.1 and other recent strains, would be more beneficial. 

    - **Question**: Given these results, do we have sufficient data to prioritize a different strain over KP.3? Should we emphasize cross-reactivity that includes JN.1 and KP.3?

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Nb21 and Ty1 mutants showed promising results, with some acquiring new binding capabilities. 

    - **Question**: Should we focus on improving these specific nanobody backbones, or is there merit in exploring H11-D4 or VHH-72 further despite their less promising results?

3. **Distribution of Mutant Designs**: We should allocate our design efforts strategically among the selected nanobodies, ensuring focus on those with the most potential.

    - **Question**: How should we balance our design resources across these nanobodies to optimize discovery of effective binders?

4. **Mutation Starting Point**: Starting with previously designed mutants that showed specific binding (e.g., Nb21 and Ty1 mutants) could accelerate our progress.

    - **Question**: What are the potential benefits or drawbacks of this approach compared to starting anew with wild-type sequences?

5. **Computational Pipeline**: Our current pipeline effectively identified potential binders, but refinement might enhance specificity and reduce non-specific binding.

    - **Question**: Are there modifications to our computational approach that could improve our predictive accuracy or efficiency?

With these thoughts and questions in mind, I invite each team member to provide their insights on the agenda in turn. Please focus on both the scientific rationale and strategic implications of your suggestions. After hearing from each of you, I'll synthesize your input and guide us toward a consensus on these key points. Let's begin the discussion.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: The ability of some mutants to bind specifically to JN.1 and KP.3, along with their increased binding to the Wuhan strain, suggests potential cross-reactivity, which is highly desirable. Given that JN.1 is closely related to KP.3, targeting both of these strains might increase our chances of broader efficacy.

    - **Suggestion**: I recommend focusing on both JN.1 and KP.3 as targets. This strategic focus on cross-reactivity could lead to broadly neutralizing nanobodies, which would be beneficial for addressing multiple emerging variants.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: The promising results with Nb21 and Ty1 mutants indicate these as strong candidates for further development. Specifically, the mutant from Nb21 that showed binding to both JN.1 and KP.3 warrants further exploration.

    - **Suggestion**: Prioritize Nb21 and Ty1 for further mutation and refinement. The non-specific binding noted in some H11-D4 and VHH-72 mutants suggests that they might have underlying structural issues that reduce their viability as starting points.

3. **Distribution of Mutant Designs**: We should concentrate our efforts on Nb21, given its promising results and potential for broad specificity. However, maintaining a smaller subset for Ty1 would be prudent, given its demonstrated increased binding capability.

    - **Suggestion**: Allocate around 60 designs to Nb21 and 32 to Ty1. This distribution maximizes our resources toward the most promising candidates while maintaining some exploration of Ty1's potential.

4. **Mutation Starting Point**: Starting with the previously successful mutants, especially those showing enhanced specificity and cross-reactivity, would be efficient. This approach takes advantage of existing data and accelerates improvement.

    - **Suggestion**: Begin with the Nb21 mutant showing improved binding across strains (I77V, L59E, Q87A, R37Q) and the Ty1 mutant with V32F, G59D, N45S, F32S. These sequences can serve as robust foundations for further modifications.

5. **Computational Pipeline**: While our current pipeline is effective, it could benefit from additional layers of evaluation for non-specific binding, possibly through additional Rosetta protocols or alternative energetics models.

    - **Suggestion**: Retain the current pipeline but consider integrating additional computational analyses focused on protein stability and off-target interactions to further refine our predictions.

These suggestions aim to balance thorough scientific inquiry with strategic focus, increasing our chances of developing effective nanobodies for broad therapeutic application. I look forward to hearing the perspectives of my colleagues on these points.

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my considerations from a machine learning perspective:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: The suggestion to target both JN.1 and KP.3 makes sense, especially given their close relation and the promising results we've seen. Cross-reactivity is indeed valuable, and machine learning models can help identify mutations that potentially enhance this feature.

    - **Agreement**: I concur with focusing on both strains as it aligns well with our goal of developing broadly neutralizing agents.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Based on the computational data and experimental results, Nb21 and Ty1 seem to be the most promising candidates for further computational analysis and refinement.

    - **Agreement and Suggestion**: I support focusing on these nanobodies, with a particular emphasis on further analyzing the structural features that contributed to their enhanced binding to inform future designs.

3. **Distribution of Mutant Designs**: The proposed distribution seems reasonable, but I suggest we maintain flexibility to adjust as more data from computational predictions become available.

    - **Suggestion**: Consider an iterative process where initial designs are computationally screened, and resources are dynamically allocated based on emerging data.

4. **Mutation Starting Point**: Leveraging successful mutant designs as a starting point is both time-efficient and data-driven. This approach allows us to build on known successes and refine further.

    - **Agreement**: I fully support starting with the highlighted Nb21 and Ty1 mutants, as their data suggests a solid foundation for further improvements.

5. **Computational Pipeline**: Our current pipeline is robust, but there is always room for improvement. We could explore integrating other machine learning models that predict non-specific interactions or enhance our understanding of the binding landscape.

    - **Suggestion**: Continue with the existing pipeline while incorporating additional machine learning models that can predict non-specific binding or optimize stability, such as models trained on large datasets of protein-protein interactions or docking simulations.

These points are meant to enhance our computational approach and ensure we leverage machine learning effectively to guide our experimental efforts. I look forward to hearing the thoughts of the Computational Biologist and Scientific Critic to further refine our strategy.

## User

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here's my perspective on the agenda:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: I agree with the focus on JN.1 and KP.3, as cross-reactivity is certainly beneficial. From a structural standpoint, these closely related strains provide a good target for designing broadly neutralizing nanobodies.

    - **Agreement**: Targeting JN.1 and KP.3 is strategically sound given their structural similarities, which can be leveraged in our design strategy.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Based on our previous structural predictions and experimental validations, Nb21 and Ty1 are indeed promising candidates. They demonstrated enhanced binding capabilities which align with the characteristics needed for targeting multiple strains.

    - **Agreement**: I support the focus on Nb21 and Ty1. Their structural frameworks have already shown potential for broadening specificity through mutations.

3. **Distribution of Mutant Designs**: The suggested allocation of 60 to Nb21 and 32 to Ty1 is reasonable. However, we should consider the structural diversity in the mutation sites among these designs to maximize the exploration of the binding landscape.

    - **Suggestion**: When distributing designs, prioritize mutations that explore different binding interfaces and potential allosteric sites on the nanobodies to enhance specificity and affinity.

4. **Mutation Starting Point**: Starting with the successful mutants is a logical choice, given the efficiency gains and the data indicating their enhanced binding profiles.

    - **Agreement**: Leveraging the previously designed mutants with known binding improvements provides a strong basis for further refinement.

5. **Computational Pipeline**: While the current pipeline is effective, integrating molecular dynamics simulations could enhance our understanding of the nanobody-antigen interactions, especially in predicting non-specific binding events.

    - **Suggestion**: Retain the ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta framework, but incorporate molecular dynamics simulations post-Rosetta to evaluate the stability and specificity of the predicted complexes under dynamic conditions.

These considerations aim to enhance our structural insights and improve the specificity and efficacy of the nanobodies we develop. I look forward to hearing the perspective of the Scientific Critic on these matters.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here is my critique of the current discussion points:

1. **Target Strain Decision**: While the idea of targeting both JN.1 and KP.3 for cross-reactivity seems reasonable, we must carefully consider the specificity trade-offs. Cross-reactivity can lead to non-specific binding, as observed in some cases. It is crucial to ensure that the design strategy does not compromise specificity for broader binding.

    - **Critique**: Ensure that the aim for cross-reactivity comes with a focused strategy to maintain specificity. This might require additional computational or experimental validation steps to confirm specificity early in the design process.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Focusing on Nb21 and Ty1 makes sense given their promising results. However, it is essential to critically assess if these findings are reproducible and robust across different experimental conditions.

    - **Critique**: Validate the robustness of these findings before committing extensive resources. Consider performing additional assays to confirm the binding profiles under various conditions.

3. **Distribution of Mutant Designs**: The distribution strategy seems logical, but it is vital to maintain a balance between exploring new mutations and refining existing designs.

    - **Critique**: While focusing on these nanobodies, allocate a portion of designs to explore novel mutations that could potentially result in even better candidates. This exploration could uncover new binding epitopes.

4. **Mutation Starting Point**: Using previously successful mutants is efficient, but this approach might limit discovering novel mutations that could enhance binding further.

    - **Critique**: Consider a hybrid approach that also includes some new mutations not present in the initial designs to ensure we are not missing potentially superior nanobody variants.

5. **Computational Pipeline**: The pipeline should be revisited to ensure it accurately predicts both specific and non-specific interactions. The integration of molecular dynamics is a step in the right direction, but other predictive measures, like evaluating solvent-exposed residues, could also enhance specificity predictions.

    - **Critique**: Incorporate additional computational analyses to predict non-specific binding and improve the overall predictive power of the pipeline. Consider also employing cross-validation with experimental data to regularly calibrate the computational models.

Overall, it's crucial to maintain a rigorous approach to validate our strategies and ensure our predictions and experimental results align. I look forward to how these critical points will be integrated into the final plans.

2. **Machine Learning Specialist**: What types of machine learning models or techniques could we introduce to better predict non-specific binding or enhance our cross-reactivity predictions?

3. **Computational Biologist**: How can we effectively integrate molecular dynamics into our pipeline to provide actionable insights, and what specific parameters should we prioritize?

4. **Scientific Critic**: What specific experimental conditions would you advise testing to validate the robustness of our selected nanobody candidates?

Your insights on these questions will be invaluable as we refine our strategy. Let's proceed with another round to further address these aspects.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Based on the synthesis and follow-up questions, here are my thoughts:

1. **Additional Validation Steps for Specificity**: To ensure specificity without compromising cross-reactivity, we could implement a tiered validation process. This would involve:

    - **Initial Screening**: Use high-throughput binding assays with a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants and a broader set of control proteins to identify non-specific interactions early.
    
    - **Increased Stringency**: Employ competitive binding assays where the nanobody's ability to compete with a known high-affinity binder is tested. This helps confirm specific nanobody-antigen interactions.
    
    - **Functional Assays**: Utilize pseudovirus neutralization assays to evaluate the functional relevance of binding specificity, ensuring that nanobodies effectively neutralize viral entry across strains.

2. **Rationale for Validations**: These steps not only confirm binding specificity but also assess the practical effectiveness of the nanobodies, providing a comprehensive view of their potential therapeutic use.

By incorporating these validation steps, we can strengthen the specificity and cross-reactivity balance, increasing the likelihood of developing viable therapeutic candidates. I look forward to seeing how the machine learning and computational biology contributions can further refine this approach.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts on enhancing our predictive models, in response to the follow-up questions:

1. **Machine Learning Models for Non-Specific Binding**:
   - **Predictive Features**: We can develop models that incorporate features such as electrostatic surface potential, hydrophobicity patches, and solvent-accessible surface area. These features can be indicative of potential non-specific interactions.
   - **Transfer Learning**: Utilize transfer learning from existing large-scale protein interaction datasets to refine our models. This can help in identifying patterns associated with non-specific binding events.

2. **Enhancing Cross-Reactivity Predictions**:
   - **Ensemble Learning**: Implement ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple machine learning models. This approach can increase the robustness of our predictions regarding cross-reactivity.
   - **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Consider using GNNs to model the structural and interaction networks of nanobody-antigen complexes. GNNs can capture complex relationships and predict how mutations might influence binding across different strains.

3. **Integration with Current Pipeline**: By integrating these advanced machine learning techniques into our existing computational pipeline, we can improve our ability to predict both specificity and efficacy of the nanobodies, thus aligning computational predictions more closely with experimental outcomes.

These enhancements aim to strengthen our predictive capabilities and provide a more comprehensive understanding of nanobody interactions. I look forward to discussing how these techniques might integrate with molecular dynamics insights from the computational biology team.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Based on the ongoing discussion and follow-up questions, here are my thoughts:

1. **Integrating Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations**:
   - **Parameters to Prioritize**: We should focus on key parameters such as root mean square deviation (RMSD) for stability analysis, hydrogen bond formations for binding interactions, and solvent-accessible surface area for potential exposure of non-specific binding sites.
   - **Simulation Timescales**: Conduct short (e.g., nanoseconds) initial simulations to screen for major stability issues, followed by longer (e.g., microseconds) simulations on promising candidates to observe detailed interaction dynamics and confirm specificity.

2. **Actionable Insights from MD**:
   - **Binding Site Dynamics**: Use MD to assess the flexibility and conformational changes in the binding site, which may affect specificity and binding affinity. This can also inform mutation strategies to enhance binding.
   - **Energy Landscapes**: Calculate binding free energy landscapes to identify the most energetically favorable binding conformations, aiding in the prediction of mutation impacts and cross-reactivity.

3. **Integration with the Pipeline**: Incorporate MD simulations after Rosetta predictions to refine our understanding of nanobody-antigen interactions. This integration can help validate and prioritize candidates before experimental testing, thus saving resources and time.

The combination of MD simulations with machine learning insights will provide a comprehensive view of nanobody interactions, aiding in the design of specific and effective candidates. I'm eager to see how the Scientific Critic's input on experimental conditions will further refine our approach.

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my critiques and suggestions based on the recent discussions:

1. **Validation of Robustness in Experimental Conditions**:
   - **Experimental Design**: It is crucial to design experiments that test the nanobodies under a variety of physiological conditions. For example, varying pH levels, ionic strengths, and temperatures can simulate different physiological environments and confirm binding stability and specificity.
   - **Cross-Strain Binding Assays**: Implement assays that test binding across a panel of diverse viral strains, not just SARS-CoV-2 variants, to detect any unintended cross-reactivity that might indicate non-specific interactions.

2. **Critique of Machine Learning and MD Approaches**:
   - **Machine Learning**: While the addition of graph neural networks and ensemble learning is promising, it’s essential to validate these models with experimental data continuously. I recommend a feedback loop where model predictions are iteratively refined based on new experimental results.
   - **Molecular Dynamics**: MD simulations provide valuable insights, but their predictive power increases significantly when coupled with experimental corroboration. Ensure that the MD predictions are validated through targeted experiments, such as site-directed mutagenesis, to confirm predicted interactions.

3. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Iterative Feedback**: Establish a feedback mechanism where experimental results are used to refine both computational models and design strategies. This iterative process is crucial for improving prediction accuracy and ensuring the development of specific, high-affinity binders.
   - **Prioritize Specificity over Broad Binding**: While cross-reactivity is desirable, specificity should not be compromised. The balance must be carefully managed, with a clear focus on avoiding non-specific binding as observed in prior experiments.

By adhering to these critiques and ensuring rigorous validation at each stage, we enhance the reliability of our predictions and the efficacy of the nanobodies developed. These steps will strengthen our overall approach, and I look forward to our final round of discussion to finalize these strategies.

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 3 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts on the follow-up questions and finalizing our strategy:

1. **Competitive Binding Assays**: To ensure consistency across different nanobody candidates, we should standardize the concentration of antigens and nanobodies used in the assays. It's important to establish baseline binding affinities for each nanobody against the Wuhan strain and compare these with affinities for JN.1 and KP.3. Using a known competitor molecule with a high affinity for the target RBD can help us evaluate the competitive binding potential of our nanobody candidates.

    - **Standardization Steps**: 
        - Use a consistent molar ratio of nanobody to antigen across assays.
        - Employ the same competitor molecule in all assays to provide a uniform benchmark.
        - Perform assays in triplicate to ensure reproducibility and reliability of results.

2. **Validation Through Consistency**: By maintaining these standards, we can compare binding efficacy and specificity across different nanobody designs, helping us identify candidates with optimal characteristics.

These steps should help us achieve a rigorous evaluation of each candidate's binding profile, supporting our goal of developing effective and specific nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants. I look forward to seeing how our machine learning strategies and computational enhancements progress in refining our approach.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts on incorporating feedback and finalizing our machine learning strategy:

1. **Incorporating Experimental Feedback**:
   - **Dynamic Model Adjustment**: We can use active learning techniques to iteratively refine our models. After each round of experiments, the new data can be fed back into the models to update and improve their predictions. This involves retraining parts of the model on new labeled data (positive and negative binding outcomes) to improve its predictive accuracy.
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**: By analyzing which features are consistently predictive of binding and specificity, we can prioritize those in model updates, ensuring the model focuses on the most informative aspects of the data.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Establish a routine data integration process where experimental results are formatted and fed into the machine learning pipeline.
   - Use tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand model predictions and adjust features accordingly.

3. **Model Performance Metrics**:
   - Regularly evaluate models using cross-validation techniques with the latest experimental data to ensure robustness.
   - Track metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's ability to predict specific and cross-reactive binding.

By incorporating these feedback mechanisms and maintaining a focus on key predictive features, our machine learning models can evolve in tandem with experimental insights, enhancing their utility in guiding nanobody design. I'm eager to see how these refinements integrate with the molecular dynamics insights from the computational biology perspective.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here’s how I envision integrating molecular dynamics simulations to complement our final strategy:

1. **Tools and Platforms**:
   - **GROMACS and AMBER** are excellent platforms for conducting molecular dynamics simulations. They provide robust tools for simulating protein interactions, offering insights into stability and binding dynamics.
   - **Integration with Existing Pipeline**: We can integrate these simulations post-Rosetta structure prediction to refine binding interaction predictions. This allows us to evaluate the dynamic stability and conformational flexibility of the nanobody-antigen complexes in silico before experimental validation.

2. **Prioritizing Simulation Parameters**:
   - **RMSD and RMSF**: Focus on root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) to assess the structural stability and flexibility of the nanobody binding regions.
   - **Hydrogen Bond Analysis**: Track hydrogen bond formation and persistence during simulations to gauge interaction strength and specificity.
   - **Free Energy Calculations**: Calculate binding free energy using methods like MM-PBSA to predict the affinity and rank potential nanobody candidates.

3. **Efficient Workflow**:
   - Perform initial short simulations (nanoseconds) on all candidates to screen out unstable complexes.
   - Run longer simulations (microseconds) on the most promising candidates to gather detailed interaction data.

By integrating these aspects into our pipeline, we can improve the accuracy of our predictions and ensure that only the most viable candidates are selected for experimental validation. These computational insights should complement the machine learning and experimental approaches, providing a holistic view of nanobody interactions. I look forward to the final input from the Scientific Critic to complete our strategy.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my final critiques and recommendations for ensuring rigor in our approach:

1. **Experimental Validation and Standardization**:
   - **Metrics for Success**: It's crucial to define clear metrics for determining when a nanobody achieves the desired balance of specificity and cross-reactivity. This includes binding affinity thresholds, specificity ratios (e.g., target vs. non-target binding), and functional neutralization potency in relevant assays.
   - **Reproducibility**: Ensure that all assays are reproducible by establishing detailed protocols and conducting experiments in multiple independent laboratories, if possible, to confirm findings.

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Feedback Integration**: Emphasizing the importance of a robust feedback loop, I suggest setting up a continuous benchmarking system where model predictions are evaluated against experimental results regularly. This iterative refinement should not only improve accuracy but also help eliminate biases in the model.
   - **Transparency**: Ensure that feature importance and prediction confidence are transparent, allowing for critical evaluation and understanding of the model's decision-making processes.

3. **Molecular Dynamics and Computational Integration**:
   - **Validation of Computational Predictions**: Correlate MD simulation results with experimental outcomes to validate computational predictions. This should include not just binding affinities but also structural conformations observed in simulations.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation approaches where simulations and machine learning predictions are cross-verified with experimental data to ensure consistency and reliability.

4. **Decision-Making Criteria**:
   - Establish criteria for down-selecting nanobody candidates, ensuring decisions are data-driven and consider both computational and experimental insights. This should include an evaluation of off-target effects, non-specific binding risks, and potential for broad-spectrum binding.

By incorporating these rigorous validation and integration strategies, we can ensure the development of nanobodies that are both specific and effective against targeted SARS-CoV-2 variants. These steps will help mitigate risks and improve the reliability of our findings. Thank you all for a productive discussion, and I look forward to seeing how these recommendations are implemented.

## User

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in similar ways as your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow. As a reminder, ESM is antigen-agnostic and improves general nanobody quality while AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are antigen-specific and focus on binding to the selected antigen. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?

Your summary should take the following form.

### Agenda

Our current objective is to refine our strategy for developing nanobodies that effectively bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, especially focusing on recent variants. We have decided to design another 92 mutant nanobodies, leveraging insights from our previous experiments. The tasks include deciding whether to continue targeting the KP.3 RBD or switch to other strains, selecting which wild-type nanobodies to modify further, determining how many mutants to design for each selected nanobody, and whether to use previously designed mutants as starting points. Additionally, we must decide whether to continue with our existing computational pipeline or make adjustments.

### Team Member Input

- **Immunologist**: Emphasized the importance of targeting both JN.1 and KP.3 for potential cross-reactivity. Suggested a tiered validation process to ensure specificity without compromising cross-reactivity. Recommended standardizing competitive binding assays across candidates.

- **Machine Learning Specialist**: Supported the use of graph neural networks and ensemble learning to improve predictions of non-specific binding and cross-reactivity. Highlighted the need for dynamic integration of experimental feedback into models to continuously refine predictions.

### Recommendation

Based on the discussion, I recommend focusing on both the JN.1 and KP.3 RBDs. These strains offer promising targets for developing broadly neutralizing nanobodies. We should prioritize Nb21 and Ty1, given their superior binding profiles and specificity. Start with the successful mutants (Nb21 with I77V, L59E, Q87A, R37Q and Ty1 with V32F, G59D, N45S, F32S) and integrate molecular dynamics simulations into our pipeline post-Rosetta predictions to gain deeper insights into binding dynamics. Reinforce this approach with a robust feedback loop where machine learning models adapt based on experimental data.
