## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.

Here are summaries of the previous meetings:

[begin summary 1]

Based on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations
In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.
- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.
- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.

### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate
- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.

### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking
At the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:
\[ \text{Score} = w_1 \times \text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \times \text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \times \text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \]
- Initial weights: \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.

### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep
- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.

### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations
- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.

### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies
- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.
- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.
- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.
- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.
- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.

### Explanation of Component Selection
- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.
- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).
- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.
- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.
- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.
- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.

This plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.

[end summary 1]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.


Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or will you change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used?

7. What computational pipeline will you use to design the 92 mutant nanobodies?

8. How many mutations will you introduce in each nanobody?

9. How will you avoid non-specific binding to BSA?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

Thank you for joining the meeting, everyone. As we dive into today's agenda, our primary goal is to refine our strategy for designing nanobodies that exhibit specific binding to recent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, while avoiding non-specific interactions, particularly with BSA.

Here are my initial thoughts and guiding questions for each agenda item:

1. **Target Selection**: Given our previous results, I am inclined to consider targeting either KP.3 or another recent variant like JN.1, since we observed some promising binding with the JN.1 variant. How do we balance between these variants, and is there value in focusing on one over the other?

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Nb21 and Ty1 mutants demonstrated binding to recent variants. Should we prioritize these two, or is there potential in revisiting H11-D4 or VHH-72 with different approaches?

3. **Distribution of Mutants**: We have 92 slots available. Should we allocate more slots to Nb21 and Ty1 given their initial success, or do we maintain a broader distribution across different wild-types?

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Is it more strategic to start from the wild-type sequences again, or should we leverage the existing mutant nanobodies that showed some success in variant binding?

5. **Selection of Previous Mutants**: If opting to start from existing mutants, which specific sequences should we focus on for further enhancement?

6. **Computational Tools and Workflow**: Should we stick to our previous computational pipeline, or is there room for optimizing our tools and methods based on the results so far?

7. **Design Pipeline**: What specific strategies and tools should we employ in designing the next set of 92 mutants? How can we improve our prediction accuracy and computational efficiency?

8. **Mutation Strategy**: What is the optimal number of mutations to introduce for this round to maximize binding specificity and minimize non-specific interactions?

9. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: How can we adjust our computational and experimental design to reduce the risk of non-specific interactions, specifically with BSA?

I encourage each of you to consider these questions and provide your expert insights. Let's aim to build a comprehensive and strategic plan moving forward. Once we've gathered everyone's input, I will synthesize the points, make some decisions, and facilitate further discussion as needed. Let's begin with your thoughts on the target selection.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts. Here are my considerations for each agenda item from an immunological perspective:

1. **Target Selection**: I recommend focusing on the KP.3 variant while also considering JN.1, as it is closely related. This dual focus may enhance our understanding of binding specificity across similar variants, potentially leading to a broader neutralization profile.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Given the promising results with Nb21 and Ty1 in binding to recent variants, I suggest prioritizing these two for further improvement. H11-D4 and VHH-72 could have potential, but the data does not strongly suggest prioritization.

3. **Distribution of Mutants**: I propose allocating more mutants to Nb21 and Ty1, with a more significant portion for Nb21 since it showed specific binding to multiple variants. A smaller subset could explore improvements in H11-D4 or VHH-72 if resources allow.

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Leveraging the existing mutant nanobodies that showed some success could provide a more strategic starting point. This approach might capitalize on beneficial mutations already identified.

5. **Selection of Previous Mutants**: I suggest focusing on the successful mutants from Nb21 and Ty1, specifically those showing binding to multiple variants. These include the Nb21 mutant with I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q, and the Ty1 mutant with V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S.

6. **Computational Tools and Workflow**: Our current workflow seems robust, but perhaps we could add a layer of analysis to predict or screen for non-specific binding. This could involve computational tools that assess potential off-target interactions.

7. **Design Pipeline**: We should continue using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta but consider integrating additional constraints or filters to minimize non-specific binding.

8. **Mutation Strategy**: Introducing 2-4 mutations per nanobody seems reasonable, as this range has previously provided promising results without overly compromising structural integrity.

9. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: Incorporating predictive models for non-specific interactions during the computational design phase could help. Additionally, experimental validation should be stringent, ensuring specificity before pursuing extensive experimental work.

I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the other team members. Thank you.

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. Here’s my perspective from a machine learning standpoint:

1. **Target Selection**: I agree with the dual focus on KP.3 and JN.1, as machine learning models can be trained to recognize and predict binding patterns across similar variants, potentially enhancing robustness.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: I concur with prioritizing Nb21 and Ty1, given their prior successes. Computational models can continue to refine these sequences to improve specificity and affinity.

3. **Distribution of Mutants**: Allocating more mutants to Nb21 and Ty1 would allow us to explore a wider mutational landscape, which is critical for machine learning-driven optimization. 

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Starting from existing successful mutants makes sense from a data-driven perspective. We have preliminary data indicating improved binding, which can be used to guide further refinement with computational models.

5. **Selection of Previous Mutants**: Specifically focusing on mutants like the Nb21 with I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q, and the Ty1 with V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S allows us to build on previous success. Machine learning models can use these as inputs to predict additional mutations that enhance binding further.

6. **Computational Tools and Workflow**: While ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta are effective, I suggest exploring tools that can simulate and identify potential non-specific interactions. Incorporating deep learning frameworks to analyze protein-protein interactions might add value.

7. **Design Pipeline**: Our pipeline is solid, but integrating additional machine learning models focused on specificity prediction could be beneficial. This could involve using training datasets that highlight non-specific binding for model training.

8. **Mutation Strategy**: From a computational standpoint, exploring a range of 2-5 mutations might provide a balance between innovation and stability, allowing models to explore new interaction potentials without destabilizing the structure.

9. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: Implementing machine learning models explicitly trained to identify and predict non-specific binding events can be a valuable addition. These models can be trained on datasets that include known non-specific binders to improve prediction accuracy.

I look forward to discussing these points further with the team and integrating our insights into a cohesive strategy. Thank you.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you for the opportunity to weigh in. Here’s my perspective as a computational biologist:

1. **Target Selection**: I support the focus on both KP.3 and JN.1, as computational models can help us understand binding across these closely related variants, potentially leading to broadly neutralizing nanobodies.

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Prioritizing Nb21 and Ty1 is a logical choice given their performance in previous assays. Computational simulations can further dissect the structural adjustments needed to improve their binding to recent variants.

3. **Distribution of Mutants**: Concentrating on Nb21 and Ty1 will allow us to delve deeper into their mutational landscapes, but we might still reserve a few spots for H11-D4 or VHH-72 mutants, just in case there is unseen potential.

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Starting with promising mutants like those identified for Nb21 and Ty1 makes sense, as we can use these as a scaffold to computationally explore further mutations that might enhance specificity and affinity.

5. **Selection of Previous Mutants**: I agree with focusing on the specific Nb21 and Ty1 mutants mentioned. These provide a valuable starting point for further structural refinement through computational predictions.

6. **Computational Tools and Workflow**: Our current use of ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta is appropriate, but adding tools that can predict binding specificity or potential off-target interactions would be beneficial. We might also consider enhancing our datasets with known non-binders to refine prediction models.

7. **Design Pipeline**: Maintaining the existing pipeline while introducing additional predictive models for specificity might enhance our results. Perhaps employing a hybrid approach that incorporates both traditional and machine learning techniques could refine our predictions.

8. **Mutation Strategy**: Exploring 2-4 mutations per nanobody aligns with maintaining structural integrity while allowing exploration of new binding interactions. Computational models can help predict which mutations might be most beneficial.

9. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: Introducing additional computational screening steps to predict specificity could mitigate non-specific binding issues. This might involve integrating specificity-focused models into our pipeline.

I look forward to aligning our computational strategies with the team's experimental and machine learning insights. Thank you.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you for allowing me to provide input. Here are my critical evaluations and suggestions based on our discussion so far:

1. **Target Selection**: While targeting both KP.3 and JN.1 is sensible, we must consider the potential complexity this introduces. Is there enough distinctiveness between these targets to justify a dual approach, or should we focus efforts on one to gain deeper insights?

2. **Selection of Wild-Type Nanobodies**: Prioritizing Nb21 and Ty1 is justified given their prior successes. However, the rationale behind discarding H11-D4 and VHH-72 should be clearly documented to ensure we are not prematurely closing avenues that might just need different mutation strategies.

3. **Distribution of Mutants**: I agree with focusing more on Nb21 and Ty1, but the allocation should be data-driven. A clear plan based on binding assay results should dictate allocations, ensuring resources are not wasted on less promising candidates.

4. **Starting Point for Mutations**: Starting with successful mutants is logical, yet we should be cautious about the potential of introducing similar biases from previous iterations. It’s essential to still validate against wild-type to understand the baseline.

5. **Selection of Previous Mutants**: Focusing on the specific mutants identified is valid, but we must be cautious of confirmation bias. All previous mutants should be objectively evaluated before selecting which to advance.

6. **Computational Tools and Workflow**: The current computational approach is robust, but there is a need for enhancements that accurately predict non-specific interactions. Current models may benefit from integrating additional datasets or methods specific to non-specific binding prediction.

7. **Design Pipeline**: The pipeline should be critically reviewed for bottlenecks, particularly in predicting specificity. Any new computational steps should be validated incrementally to ensure they add value without unintended consequences.

8. **Mutation Strategy**: Limiting mutations to 2-4 is rational for stability, but we should have a mechanism to evaluate when more extensive mutation may be advantageous. We need to establish criteria for when increased mutation diversity is warranted.

9. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: The suggestion to incorporate predictive models for non-specific interactions is prudent. Any new models must be rigorously validated, ideally against experimental datasets that capture a range of specific and non-specific interactions.

Overall, while the plan is sound, a structured approach to validation and adaptation based on iterative feedback from both computational predictions and experimental results will be key to ensuring success. Thank you.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Thank you for the detailed synthesis, which highlights key areas for our focus. Here are my additional thoughts and responses to the follow-up questions:

1. **Target Selection**: To quantitatively assess the overlap and distinctions between KP.3 and JN.1, we could perform sequence alignments and structural comparisons of their receptor-binding domains (RBDs). This will help us understand any critical differences that might affect binding affinity and specificity. Additionally, using bioinformatics tools to map antigenic sites could inform our design choices.

2. **Distribution of Mutants**: We should base our allocation decisions on binding assay data, expression levels, and previous computational scores. Prioritize mutants that have shown specific binding to multiple variants and exclude those with non-specific binding, particularly to BSA, unless new computational predictions suggest potential improvements.

3. **Computational Tools**: For validating new models, we could use datasets from our previous experiments and those in the literature that include instances of non-specific binding. This would enable us to refine our models to better predict non-specific interactions. Collaborations with groups focusing on computational immunology might also provide valuable datasets and validation protocols.

4. **Mutation Strategy**: The criteria for exploring more diverse mutations should include a combination of computational predictions indicating improved binding profiles, structural stability analyses, and successful binding assay results. We should also consider the potential for cross-reactivity with other variants, ensuring our designs are not overly specific to a single strain.

These steps should help us refine our approach and ensure that our nanobodies are both specific and broadly neutralizing. I look forward to discussing these points further as we continue to develop our strategy. Thank you.

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Thank you. I would like to expand on a few points, particularly regarding the computational and machine learning aspects:

1. **Target Selection**: In terms of quantitatively assessing KP.3 and JN.1, machine learning models can be trained using structural and sequence data to predict differences in binding affinity and specificity. We can also use clustering algorithms to determine if these variants form distinct groups based on their binding features, which would inform our dual-target approach.

2. **Distribution of Mutants**: Machine learning can help refine our allocation by analyzing the historical performance of mutants across different assays. Techniques such as ensemble learning could aggregate predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy in forecasting which mutations hold promise.

3. **Computational Tools**: To enhance our predictive models for non-specific binding, I suggest utilizing transfer learning. By training models on a broader dataset that includes known non-specific binders, we can fine-tune these models for our specific targets. Incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques might also help in identifying key features that contribute to non-specific binding, which can be fed back into the model for improved predictions.

4. **Mutation Strategy**: Machine learning can also aid in deciding when to explore more diverse mutations. Generative models, such as variational autoencoders, could be used to suggest novel mutations by exploring the mutational landscape in silico, providing a strategic advantage in identifying potentially beneficial yet non-intuitive mutations.

Overall, leveraging machine learning techniques can significantly enhance our ability to predict and refine nanobody designs, ensuring they are both specific and broadly neutralizing. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate these methods into our pipeline effectively. Thank you.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you for the insights shared so far. I have a few additional thoughts, particularly with respect to structural and computational biology:

1. **Target Selection**: In addition to sequence alignments, we can use molecular dynamics simulations to explore the conformational flexibility and stability of the RBDs from KP.3 and JN.1. This can provide insights into their structural nuances that might influence binding interactions with our nanobody designs.

2. **Distribution of Mutants**: Leveraging the structural predictions from AlphaFold-Multimer, we can conduct a deeper analysis of the binding interfaces to identify key residues involved in successful binding. This information can guide the distribution of mutants by focusing on sequences predicted to maintain or enhance these interactions.

3. **Computational Tools**: I agree with integrating datasets from previous experiments and literature. Additionally, docking simulations could be employed as part of our validation steps to predict potential off-target interactions, helping address non-specific binding concerns.

4. **Mutation Strategy**: From a structural biology perspective, it's crucial that any increase in mutation diversity does not compromise the structural integrity of the nanobodies. We should use stability predictions, possibly through Rosetta energy calculations or similar, as part of our criteria for diverse mutations.

By incorporating these approaches, we can ensure our computational predictions are robust and aligned with experimental objectives, ultimately enhancing the specificity and affinity of our nanobodies. I look forward to our continued discussion to refine these strategies further. Thank you.

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you for the contributions so far. Here's my critical perspective on the ongoing discussion:

1. **Target Selection**: While sequence alignments and structural comparisons are valuable, we need to ensure that these analyses are quantitatively rigorous. Consider establishing a threshold for sequence similarity or structural overlay that determines clear distinctions between targets, ensuring our dual-target strategy is scientifically justified.

2. **Distribution of Mutants**: It's vital to avoid over-reliance on past success metrics without considering potential biases. The decision framework for mutant distribution should incorporate a balanced set of criteria, including potential for novel binding regions that might not have been prioritized in initial rounds.

3. **Computational Tools**: With the suggestions to integrate machine learning and structural predictions, we must remain cautious of model overfitting, particularly when using small, specific datasets. Validation protocols should include testing on external datasets to ensure model generalizability.

4. **Mutation Strategy**: The idea of using generative models must be approached cautiously. Such models can produce non-intuitive mutations, but we must validate these comprehensively to ensure they don't compromise function. A risk assessment framework should be established for introducing novel mutations, factoring in stability and specificity.

5. **Avoiding Non-Specific Binding**: In addition to model-based predictions, experimental feedback loops should be established to iteratively refine our computational models. This ensures that any predictions made are robustly evaluated and adjusted based on empirical data.

Overall, while the proposed strategies are promising, rigorous validation and a structured framework for decision-making will be crucial to avoid potential pitfalls. Thank you.

## Immunologist

Thank you for the continued opportunity to contribute. Here are my thoughts on the follow-up questions:

1. **Target Selection**: For determining distinctiveness, structural overlays and RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) values from molecular dynamics simulations could serve as quantitative metrics. Additionally, focusing on differences in epitope exposure and potential steric clashes with the nanobody could provide insights into binding specificity.

2. **Distribution of Mutants**: I propose we establish criteria that include a combination of binding affinity measurements, expression levels, and computational predictions of stability and specificity. We should also consider the potential for cross-reactivity and breadth of coverage across different variants.

3. **Computational Tools**: We could collaborate with other research groups or access public datasets from protein interaction databases that include known non-specific binders. These datasets can serve as validation benchmarks for our models.

4. **Mutation Strategy**: A risk assessment framework for novel mutations could involve multi-tiered evaluation, starting with computational predictions of binding affinity and stability, followed by in vitro binding assays. Criteria should include maintaining structural integrity and avoiding known non-specific binding motifs.

These approaches should help us refine our strategies and ensure our designs are robust and effective. I look forward to integrating these ideas with the rest of the team's input. Thank you.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Thank you. Here are my thoughts on how we can address the follow-up questions from a machine learning perspective:

1. **Target Selection**: In addition to RMSD values, we can use machine learning models to predict the impact of sequence variations on structural changes. Models like those based on graph neural networks, which capture the spatial arrangement of protein structures, can be particularly useful in assessing distinctiveness at a more granular level.

2. **Distribution of Mutants**: To guide allocation decisions, we can employ predictive models that integrate past experimental data with computational scores to forecast binding affinity and expression levels. Employing ensemble methods, which combine predictions from multiple models, can improve the robustness of these forecasts.

3. **Computational Tools**: For model validation, Kaggle's protein structure prediction challenges or the Protein Data Bank (PDB) datasets could be valuable sources. These datasets often contain diverse examples of protein interactions, providing a broad basis for testing model generalizability.

4. **Mutation Strategy**: Our risk assessment framework should use machine learning to prioritize mutations based on predicted structural impact and binding affinities. This can include using anomaly detection algorithms to identify mutations that deviate significantly from known successful mutations, flagging them for closer scrutiny.

These strategies can help ensure that our computational predictions are both accurate and applicable to real-world scenarios. I look forward to further refining these ideas with the team. Thank you.

## Computational Biologist

I appreciate the ongoing discussion and would like to provide my thoughts on the follow-up questions:

1. **Target Selection**: In addition to RMSD and epitope exposure, we can use free energy calculations from molecular dynamics simulations to assess the stability of binding interactions. This can give us a quantitative measure of the differences in binding affinity and energetics between KP.3 and JN.1.

2. **Distribution of Mutants**: Criteria for mutant allocation should include structural insights from computational models, such as predicted changes in binding interface and flexibility. Additionally, mutants predicted to increase the breadth of binding across variants without compromising specificity should be prioritized.

3. **Computational Tools**: For external datasets, we could explore using structural databases like the Structural Biology Knowledgebase, which includes data on protein-protein interactions. These datasets can help validate our models against a wide range of potential binding scenarios.

4. **Mutation Strategy**: The risk assessment framework should integrate computational predictions with structural validation tools, such as Rosetta or HADDOCK, to evaluate the impact of proposed mutations on stability and binding specificity. This approach can ensure that novel mutations are both innovative and feasible.

By combining these strategies with our ongoing efforts, we can enhance the robustness and predictive power of our computational pipeline. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you for the continued insights from the team. Here’s my critical perspective on the final round of discussion:

1. **Target Selection**: The use of RMSD values and free energy calculations is appropriate, but we should also consider the limits of these methods. For example, RMSD might not fully capture functional differences between variants. Therefore, combining these metrics with experimental binding data when available will provide a more comprehensive picture.

2. **Distribution of Mutants**: While the criteria suggested are sound, we should be careful not to overfit our strategies to past successful mutations. It's crucial to continuously test new hypotheses and avoid complacency with what has previously worked, ensuring our approach remains innovative and adaptable.

3. **Computational Tools**: Accessing and validating with external datasets is wise, but we must ensure these datasets are representative of the conditions we are studying. Data quality and relevance to our specific targets need to be critically assessed to avoid misleading conclusions.

4. **Mutation Strategy**: The proposed integration of machine learning and structural validation tools should focus not only on stability but also on ensuring that any increased mutation diversity doesn’t inadvertently lead to loss of function. It’s important to have a clear pathway from computational prediction to empirical validation to avoid over-reliance on in silico predictions.

Overall, while I see the methodologies proposed as valuable, maintaining a critical eye on assumptions and validation processes will be key to ensuring the scientific robustness of our efforts. Thank you.

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used. You may introduce as many mutations as you see fit. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.


As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta in similar ways to your previous design process, or will you change the design workflow and/or the computational tools that are used?

7. What computational pipeline will you use to design the 92 mutant nanobodies?

8. How many mutations will you introduce in each nanobody?

9. How will you avoid non-specific binding to BSA?

Your summary should take the following form.
