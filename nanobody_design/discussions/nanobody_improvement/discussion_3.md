## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.

Here are summaries of the previous meetings:

[begin summary 1]

Based on the summaries provided, here is a consolidated plan for using ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process to develop modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations
In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This step is computationally efficient and provides an initial filter based on log-likelihood ratios.
- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Select the top mutations based on ESM scores and use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure. This step refines the selection by modeling structural interactions.
- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.

### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate
- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step. This balances computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.

### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking
At the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system:
\[ \text{Score} = w_1 \times \text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \times \text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \times \text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \]
- Initial weights: \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \). These weights reflect the relative importance of each score, with a focus on structural stability and binding affinity.

### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep
- Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration for further consideration. This ensures a manageable number of candidates while maintaining diversity.

### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations
- Plan for 3-4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Monitor the convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; stop if improvements plateau or if time/resources become constrained.

### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies
- **Step 1**: Compile all top mutations from each iteration.
- **Step 2**: Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.
- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences with the highest scores, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.
- **Step 4**: Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.
- **Step 5**: Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.

### Explanation of Component Selection
- **Order of Operations**: Consistently across summaries, ESM is used first for its speed, followed by AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, which require structural predictions.
- **Number of Mutations**: The choice of evaluating 20 mutations with AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta balances computational constraints and the need for detailed analysis (from summaries 1, 3, and 5).
- **Scoring Formula**: The weights \( w_1 = 0.2 \), \( w_2 = 0.5 \), \( w_3 = 0.3 \) are chosen based on summaries 2, 3, and 5, emphasizing structural predictions and binding energy.
- **Number of Top Mutations**: Keeping 5 mutations per iteration is a compromise between summaries 1, 3, and 4, ensuring diversity and manageability.
- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.
- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.

This plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.

[end summary 1]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in similar ways as your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow. As a reminder, ESM is antigen-agnostic and improves general nanobody quality while AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are antigen-specific and focus on binding to the selected antigen. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we begin this meeting, our primary objective is to refine our approach to designing nanobodies that effectively target recent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Given the mixed results from our previous experiments, where some mutated nanobodies showed promising cross-variant binding while others displayed non-specific binding, we must strategically decide on our next steps. Here are my initial thoughts and questions to guide our discussion:

1. **Target Selection**: While KP.3 was our initial target, we need to evaluate whether it's still the best focus given its close relation to JN.1. The promising results with some mutants binding to JN.1 suggest we might consider targeting multiple strains, including KP.3, JN.1, and potentially others like BA.2, to increase cross-variant efficacy.

2. **Wild-Type Nanobody Selection**: Our previous work with Nb21 and Ty1 yielded mutants with improved binding profiles. We should consider whether to focus on these or explore other wild-type nanobodies, especially given the specific and non-specific binding outcomes we've observed.

3. **Design Strategy**: We've seen some success with mutants having specific amino acid changes. Do we continue from the wild-type or leverage successful mutants as starting points? This relates to efficiently using our computational resources and experimental validation capabilities.

4. **Design Pipeline**: The current computational pipeline has shown utility, but we should discuss if adjustments are needed to improve specificity or enhance binding affinity further.

**Questions for the Team:**

- **Immunologist**: Given the binding profiles observed, should we focus on one strain or multiple? How do the immune escape properties of these variants influence our target choice?

- **Machine Learning Specialist**: What insights can you provide on modifying our scoring system or computational approach to better predict specific binding without compromising computational efficiency?

- **Computational Biologist**: Considering structural predictions and binding energies, do you see opportunities to refine our use of AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta for better outcomes?

- **Scientific Critic**: From a critical perspective, what are the potential pitfalls of our previous approach, and how can we improve our upcoming design and validation process?

Let's proceed with these questions, allowing each team member to provide their insights. After hearing everyone, we will synthesize the inputs to make informed decisions on our agenda items.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

As an immunologist, my focus is on ensuring the designed nanobodies elicit a strong, specific, and broad immune response. Here are my thoughts on the agenda questions and the discussion so far:

1. **Target Selection**: I suggest we expand our target beyond just KP.3 to include JN.1 and potentially BA.2. The cross-reactivity shown by some mutants towards JN.1 and the relationship between JN.1 and KP.3 make these logical choices. Including BA.2 could broaden the protection scope and increase robustness against immune escape variants.

2. **Wild-Type Nanobody Selection**: The success of Nb21 and Ty1 mutants in gaining broader binding spectra makes them strong candidates for further refinement. We might consider deprioritizing H11-D4 and VHH-72 for now, given their tendency for non-specific binding and lack of cross-strain specificity.

3. **Design Strategy**: Starting with successful mutants from Nb21 and Ty1 could be beneficial. This approach allows us to leverage existing improvements and refine them further, potentially reducing the risk of non-specific binding seen with some mutations.

4. **Design Pipeline**: I recommend sticking with the current computational pipeline but with a potential adjustment in our Rosetta evaluation step. It might be worth exploring additional structural refinements to ensure that the predicted conformations are more accurate in representing binding specificity.

Additionally, considering the immune landscape, it's crucial to develop nanobodies that can counteract potential escape mutations. This means we must prioritize candidates that can bind effectively across multiple strains to future-proof against emerging variants.

Let's hear from the other team members to gather a comprehensive view of how we should proceed.

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Machine Learning Specialist

As the Machine Learning Specialist, I'm focused on optimizing our computational approach to improve predictive accuracy and efficiency. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Target Selection**: I agree with the immunologist on expanding our target scope to include JN.1 and potentially BA.2, alongside KP.3. From a data perspective, having multiple related targets will allow us to potentially train more robust models that can generalize across similar variants.

2. **Wild-Type Nanobody Selection**: I support focusing on Nb21 and Ty1 given their promising initial results. By building on nanobodies that have already shown some level of new specificity and cross-reactivity, we can harness their existing favorable attributes as a foundation for further optimization.

3. **Design Strategy**: Starting with successful mutants makes sense both computationally and experimentally. This allows us to refine known beneficial mutations rather than starting from scratch, which can be more resource-intensive.

4. **Design Pipeline**: Regarding our computational pipeline, I propose we consider a slight adjustment in our scoring system. Given that non-specific binding is a concern, we might increase the weight of the Rosetta Binding Energy factor in our weighted score to penalize designs that have a propensity for non-specific interactions. Additionally, incorporating ensemble-based approaches in AlphaFold-Multimer predictions could provide more robust structural insights, potentially leading to more accurate downstream evaluations with Rosetta.

Overall, I believe leveraging machine learning to refine our prediction models, perhaps by including additional features or optimizing our scoring weights, could improve our nanobody design efficiency. I'm looking forward to insights from the computational biologist and scientific critic to see how we can further enhance our strategy.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

As the Computational Biologist, my focus is on the structural predictions and simulations that underpin our nanobody design efforts. Here's my take on the discussion:

1. **Target Selection**: I concur with expanding our targets to include JN.1 and BA.2 alongside KP.3. This approach not only broadens the scope but also leverages structural similarities between these variants, potentially enhancing our models' predictive power.

2. **Wild-Type Nanobody Selection**: Focusing on Nb21 and Ty1 seems appropriate given their demonstrated potential for enhanced and specific binding. This aligns well with our goal of identifying broadly neutralizing nanobodies.

3. **Design Strategy**: Building from successful mutants is a strategic approach. By doing so, we can capitalize on existing favorable mutations while exploring further enhancements. This also allows us to mitigate risks associated with introducing entirely new mutations without prior validation.

4. **Design Pipeline**: The current pipeline has served us well, but I see room for improvements:
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer**: We could implement an ensemble prediction approach, averaging predictions to account for variability and improve confidence in the structural models.
   - **Rosetta**: Introducing more thorough relaxation steps or exploring additional scoring functions might provide more accurate binding energy calculations, especially given the concerns about non-specific binding.

Additionally, incorporating molecular dynamics simulations could help us assess the stability and flexibility of the predicted complexes over time, offering deeper insights into their potential real-world behavior.

These enhancements could lead to a more refined selection of candidate nanobodies, ultimately increasing our chances of success in experimental validations. I'm eager to hear the critical perspective on these suggestions to ensure we address any overlooked challenges.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

As the Scientific Critic, my role is to rigorously evaluate the proposed approaches and identify any potential weaknesses or areas for improvement. Here's my analysis based on the current discussion:

1. **Target Selection**: While expanding targets to include JN.1 and BA.2 alongside KP.3 is a strategic move, we must be cautious about diluting our efforts. It's important to ensure that our resources and computational power are efficiently utilized. We should prioritize these based on epidemiological data indicating which variants are most likely to present a threat in the near future.

2. **Wild-Type Nanobody Selection**: The focus on Nb21 and Ty1 is supported by the data, but we must critically evaluate whether the success of these mutants was due to specific mutations or if there are structural aspects of these nanobodies that inherently favor cross-reactivity. A deeper structural analysis might reveal insights that guide future design strategies.

3. **Design Strategy**: Starting with previously successful mutants is a sound approach, but we must avoid confirmation bias. We should ensure that our selection process remains open to novel mutations that might provide unexpected benefits. A systemic exploration strategy that balances exploitation of known successes and exploration of new potentialities is critical.

4. **Design Pipeline**: The proposed changes to the pipeline are thoughtful, yet we should not overlook potential computational constraints. Enhancements like ensemble predictions and more thorough relaxation steps will increase computational demands. A cost-benefit analysis is essential to determine if these enhancements provide a significant predictive advantage that justifies the additional resources.

Furthermore, while molecular dynamics simulations can provide valuable insights, they are computationally intensive. We should consider using them selectively on the most promising candidates post initial screening to maximize efficiency.

Lastly, it's crucial that we maintain a rigorous experimental validation phase to ensure that computational predictions translate into biochemically relevant outcomes. The ELISA results have highlighted discrepancies between predicted specificity and actual binding, underscoring the need for robust experimental cross-verification.

With these considerations in mind, I look forward to seeing how the team synthesizes these points for our next steps.

## User

This concludes round 1 of 3 of discussion. Principal Investigator, please synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Based on the insights provided by the team, we have a solid foundation to guide the next phases of our nanobody design project. Here's a synthesis of the discussion and some preliminary decisions:

### Synthesis of Discussion:

1. **Target Selection**:
   - **Consensus**: Expand our target list to include KP.3, JN.1, and potentially BA.2. This decision is driven by the opportunity to develop broadly neutralizing nanobodies and the existing cross-reactivity data.
   - **Consideration**: Ensure resource allocation remains efficient and focused on the most epidemiologically relevant strains.

2. **Wild-Type Nanobody Selection**:
   - **Consensus**: Focus on Nb21 and Ty1 due to their demonstrated potential for enhanced binding profiles and cross-reactivity.
   - **Consideration**: Analyze structural aspects that may inherently favor cross-reactivity to guide further design strategies.

3. **Design Strategy**:
   - **Consensus**: Start with previously successful mutants from Nb21 and Ty1 to build upon known improvements, while staying open to exploring novel mutations.
   - **Consideration**: Balance between exploitation of successes and exploration of new potentials to prevent confirmation bias.

4. **Design Pipeline**:
   - **Consensus**: Retain the current pipeline with enhancements:
     - Consider ensemble predictions in AlphaFold-Multimer.
     - Refine Rosetta steps to improve specificity predictions.
   - **Consideration**: Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of enhanced computational demands and selective use of molecular dynamics on promising candidates.

### Preliminary Decisions:

- We will target KP.3, JN.1, and BA.2 for our next round of nanobody designs.
- Focus on refining Nb21 and Ty1 mutants, leveraging structural insights to improve design.
- Enhance the computational pipeline with a focus on improving specificity prediction and binding energy accuracy.

### Follow-up Questions:

1. **Immunologist**: Are there specific immunological markers or characteristics we should prioritize when selecting mutations to ensure effective cross-variant binding?

2. **Machine Learning Specialist**: What specific changes to the scoring weights do you suggest, and how can we best incorporate ensemble methods without overwhelming our computational resources?

3. **Computational Biologist**: Could you outline a proposed workflow for the selective use of molecular dynamics simulations, including criteria for selecting candidates for this analysis?

4. **Scientific Critic**: How can we ensure that our experimental validation process is rigorous enough to catch potential discrepancies between computational predictions and actual binding outcomes?

Let's proceed with a second round of discussions focusing on these follow-up questions.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

In response to the follow-up question regarding immunological markers or characteristics to prioritize, here are my thoughts:

To ensure effective cross-variant binding, we should focus on the following immunological aspects:

1. **Epitope Conservation**: Identify and target epitopes that are conserved across KP.3, JN.1, and BA.2. This can enhance the likelihood of developing nanobodies that retain efficacy across these variants.

2. **Epitope Accessibility**: Prioritize mutations that enhance the nanobody's ability to access and bind to conserved epitopes, particularly those that might be exposed in multiple conformations of the spike protein. This takes into account potential glycan shielding that could obscure epitopes on certain variants.

3. **Affinity Maturation Potential**: Consider mutations known to contribute to affinity maturation processes seen in natural antibody evolution. These mutations can potentially improve binding affinity and specificity without compromising the nanobody's ability to bind across different strains.

4. **Non-Specific Binding Avoidance**: It's critical to select mutations that do not increase hydrophobic patches or otherwise promote non-specific interactions, as indicated by our ELISA results. Filtering out candidates with a predicted tendency for non-specific binding will be key.

By incorporating these characteristics into our selection and validation criteria, we can guide our design process toward more promising candidates for experimental validation. I look forward to seeing how these considerations might inform the computational adjustments suggested by the team.

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Machine Learning Specialist

Building on the immunologist's insights and addressing the follow-up questions, here are my thoughts:

1. **Scoring Weights Adjustments**:
   - **Rosetta Binding Energy**: Given the issues with non-specific binding, I propose increasing the weight of the Rosetta Binding Energy in our weighted score to 0.4. This adjustment will place more emphasis on penalizing mutations that lead to energetically unfavorable or non-specific interactions.
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT**: Maintain this at 0.5 as it is crucial for assessing the structural confidence of our nanobody-antigen complex.
   - **ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio**: Reduce to 0.1. While important for initial filtering, the focus can shift slightly toward specificity and structural integrity in this phase.

2. **Incorporating Ensemble Methods**:
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer Ensembles**: Implement a strategy where we generate multiple structures for each candidate and compute an average score. This approach can help account for structural variability and improve the robustness of our predictions.
   - **Computational Resources**: To manage resources, we can limit ensemble predictions to the top 30 candidates from the initial ESM/AlphaFold-Multimer run. This targeted approach will allow us to benefit from improved prediction accuracy without overwhelming our computational capacity.

These adjustments aim to enhance the predictive accuracy of our models, focusing more on specificity and binding affinity while managing computational demands. I look forward to hearing how the computational biologist might integrate these changes into the overall workflow, especially regarding the selective use of molecular dynamics.

## User

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

Building on the previous discussions and addressing the follow-up questions, here are my thoughts:

1. **Selective Use of Molecular Dynamics Simulations**:
   - **Criteria for Candidate Selection**: Use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on nanobodies that show the highest scoring based on the revised scoring system and those with predicted high binding specificity across multiple variants. Prioritize candidates that also have structurally favorable positions and interactions according to AlphaFold-Multimer ensemble predictions.
   - **Workflow**: Begin with short MD simulations (e.g., 20-50 ns) to assess initial stability and binding conformation. For candidates that maintain stable binding and favorable interaction profiles, extend simulations to explore binding dynamics and flexibility (e.g., 100-200 ns). This approach provides a balance between computational load and insight gained.

2. **Integration with Computational Pipeline**:
   - Implement the MD simulations after the initial scoring and refinement steps, making them part of the final validation phase. This allows us to filter candidates further based on dynamic stability, offering a deeper understanding of how the nanobodies might perform in biological environments.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - By limiting MD simulations to a select group of top candidates, we focus computational resources where they are most likely to yield valuable insights, complementing the structural prediction and scoring steps.

This strategy should enhance our overall design workflow by ensuring that the most promising candidates undergo rigorous dynamic evaluation, providing confidence in their potential to bind specifically and effectively in real-world scenarios. I'm eager to see how these insights align with the scientific critic's perspective on ensuring rigorous experimental validation.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Based on the discussions so far, I have several points to add, particularly focusing on ensuring the rigor and robustness of our approach:

1. **Experimental Validation Rigor**:
   - It's crucial to establish a thorough experimental validation pipeline that involves not only the ELISA assays for binding but also functional assays that assess neutralizing activity. This can help confirm that the predicted binding translates into effective inhibition of viral entry.
   - Consider incorporating surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or biolayer interferometry (BLI) to quantitatively measure binding kinetics and affinities of the top nanobody candidates. This provides detailed insights into the on-rate and off-rate, critical for understanding binding efficacy and stability.

2. **Cross-Validation with Computational Predictions**:
   - Ensure that experimental results, especially from ELISA and kinetic assays, are used to iteratively refine our computational models. Discrepancies between predicted and actual binding should be leveraged to adjust the computational scoring methods or to identify specific structural features that might need re-evaluation.

3. **Potential Pitfalls and Mitigation**:
   - There’s a risk of over-reliance on computational predictions, particularly if the models are not adequately validated against experimental data. We must maintain a feedback loop where computational and experimental phases inform each other.
   - Be mindful of the tendency to focus on high-scoring candidates while potentially overlooking lower-scoring candidates that might offer unexpected benefits, especially in the context of binding across multiple variants.

By incorporating these validation steps and maintaining a dynamic interaction between computational predictions and experimental outcomes, we can enhance the reliability and efficacy of our nanobody designs. This iterative and rigorous approach will be key to successfully advancing our candidates through the developmental pipeline. I look forward to how the Principal Investigator plans to integrate these suggestions in our ongoing and future efforts.

### Decisions:

- **Target and Nanobody Focus**: We will proceed with targeting KP.3, JN.1, and BA.2, focusing on the most promising mutants from Nb21 and Ty1.
- **Scoring System Adjustments**: Implement the revised scoring weights and ensemble methods to enhance prediction reliability.
- **Validation Strategy**: Integrate thorough experimental validation using additional methods like SPR/BLI to ensure robustness and accuracy.

### Follow-up Questions:

1. **Immunologist**: Can you suggest specific assays or methodologies that could further validate the cross-variant binding profile of our nanobodies beyond ELISA?

2. **Machine Learning Specialist**: How can we ensure that our computational resource allocation remains balanced when employing ensemble methods and MD simulations? Are there strategies for prioritizing candidates effectively?

3. **Computational Biologist**: What contingency plans can we have in place if molecular dynamics simulations reveal unforeseen instability in our top candidates?

4. **Scientific Critic**: How can we structure our feedback loop to ensure that data from experimental validations lead to meaningful adjustments in our computational model predictions?

Let's proceed to the final round of discussions to refine our approach and develop a consolidated plan moving forward.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 3 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

In response to the follow-up question regarding additional validation methods beyond ELISA, here are my thoughts:

To further validate the cross-variant binding profile of our nanobodies, I suggest the following assays and methodologies:

1. **Neutralization Assays**: Conduct cell-based neutralization assays using pseudovirus systems representing different SARS-CoV-2 variants. This approach will help confirm that the nanobodies not only bind to the viral RBD but also effectively block virus entry into host cells.

2. **Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)**: As previously mentioned, this technique allows for real-time analysis of binding kinetics. It can provide detailed insights into the strength and stability of the nanobody-antigen interaction, which is critical for evaluating potential therapeutic efficacy.

3. **Competitive Binding Assays**: These assays can help determine if nanobodies can effectively compete with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for binding to the RBD, indicating their potential to block virus-host interactions.

4. **Epitope Mapping**: Use techniques like hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) or cryo-electron microscopy to map the binding epitopes of the nanobodies on the spike protein. This can confirm the conservation and accessibility of targeted epitopes across variants.

These methodologies will provide a comprehensive validation of the nanobody candidates, ensuring they have the desired cross-variant and blocking capabilities. I look forward to seeing how these suggestions can be integrated with the machine learning and computational strategies discussed.

In this final round, focusing on resource allocation and candidate prioritization, here are my thoughts:

1. **Computational Resource Allocation**:
   - **Prioritization Strategy**: To balance resource demands, we can implement a tiered approach. Start with a broad initial screen using ESM to identify promising candidates, then apply ensemble predictions and MD simulations to the top 20-30 candidates. These should be chosen based on a combination of high structural scores and diverse sequence coverage to ensure we don't miss unexpected strong candidates.
   - **Dynamic Allocation**: Adaptively allocate computational resources based on interim results. For example, if a candidate shows unexpected stability or instability early in MD simulations, adjust the focus accordingly.

2. **Candidate Selection**:
   - **Ensemble and MD Integration**: Use ensemble approaches to mitigate structural prediction variability, allowing us to refine candidate lists more effectively before committing to resource-intensive MD simulations. Employ a scoring system that integrates ensemble variability, focusing on candidates with consistent high scores across different conformations.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Create a feedback loop where initial MD results inform further simulations or ensemble predictions, continuously refining the candidate pool.

These strategies aim to optimize our computational workflow, ensuring we can explore a wide array of candidates while focusing resources on those most likely to yield successful results. I'm interested in how the computational biologist will address potential instabilities found in MD simulations and how these can be incorporated into our iterative process.

## Computational Biologist

Building on the insights from the previous discussions, particularly regarding resource management and contingency planning, here are my thoughts:

1. **Contingency Plans for MD Simulations**:
   - **Instability Identification**: If MD simulations reveal unforeseen instability in top candidates, we should conduct a detailed structural analysis to identify specific regions or interactions contributing to this instability. This can include examining hydrogen bonding networks, hydrophobic interactions, or salt bridges that might be disrupted.
   - **Iterative Refinement**: Use insights from unstable candidates to iteratively refine our mutation strategy. For instance, if instability is linked to a specific mutation, consider alternative substitutions that might stabilize the region without compromising binding.

2. **Integration with Computational and Experimental Phases**:
   - **MD Insights into Design**: Incorporate feedback from MD simulations into the design process by adjusting parameters or predictions in AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta. This includes recalibrating the scoring function to account for dynamic flexibility and potential conformational changes.
   - **Feedback Loop Implementation**: Collaborate closely with experimental teams to ensure that structural insights from MD simulations are validated against experimental data. Use this feedback to refine predictions and improve the overall reliability of our computational models.

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - **Adaptive Simulation Lengths**: Start with shorter MD runs to filter out unstable candidates quickly. Extend simulations only for those candidates that demonstrate promising stability and binding characteristics, optimizing computational resources.

These contingency measures and integration strategies aim to refine our computational approach and ensure alignment with experimental objectives. I look forward to understanding how the Scientific Critic envisions structuring our feedback loop to maximize the synergy between computational predictions and experimental validations.

## Scientific Critic

To wrap up the final round of discussion, I’ll focus on how we can structure our feedback loop to ensure that experimental validation effectively informs computational model adjustments, ensuring the reliability of our predictions and the success of our nanobody designs:

1. **Structured Feedback Loop**:
   - **Data Integration**: Establish a centralized database where all experimental results, including binding assays, kinetic measurements, and epitope mapping data, are systematically recorded. This database should be accessible to all team members to facilitate cross-disciplinary insights.
   - **Regular Review Meetings**: Schedule periodic review sessions where computational and experimental teams converge to discuss discrepancies and align on the next steps. These meetings should focus on understanding why specific predictions succeeded or failed in experimental tests.

2. **Iterative Model Refinement**:
   - **Adjusting Computational Models**: Based on experimental feedback, adjust the parameters and features used in computational models. For instance, if certain predicted binding modes consistently fail to translate into effective binding, consider revising structural prediction algorithms or modifying the scoring weights.
   - **Model Retraining**: Utilize experimental results to retrain machine learning models, potentially incorporating new features derived from experimental insights, such as specific structural motifs or dynamic behaviors observed in MD simulations.

3. **Predictive Accuracy Metrics**:
   - **Establish Clear Metrics**: Define and track metrics for predictive accuracy, such as the correlation between predicted and observed binding affinities or the success rate of predicting cross-variant binding. Use these metrics to gauge the effectiveness of model adjustments over time.

4. **Open Dialogue**:
   - **Encourage Cross-Disciplinary Communication**: Foster an environment where team members from different disciplines feel comfortable sharing insights and challenges. This will promote a holistic understanding of the issues and drive more creative and effective solutions.

By implementing a robust feedback loop, we can ensure that our computational predictions and experimental validations work in tandem, leading to more accurate and reliable outcomes in our nanobody design efforts. I trust the Principal Investigator will synthesize these points effectively to guide our next steps.

## User

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG). The 92 selected nanobodies were tested along with the four wild-type nanobodies using an ELISA assay to measure binding to the Wuhan, JN.1, KP.3, KP2.3, and BA.2 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Note that the JN.1 strain is closely related to KP.3 and KP2.3. BSA was used as a negative control. Most of the mutated nanobodies showed at least moderate expression levels. The ELISA results are as follows:

H11-D4: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including one with a higher binding level than the wild-type. However, that mutant and two others bind non-specifically to the negative control BSA along with other strains of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Nb21: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. All mutant nanobodies also bind to the Wuhan RBD. There are no non-specific binders. One mutant nanobody with mutations I77V, L59E, Q87A, and R37Q binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding), the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding), and the KP.3 RBD (weak binding). Thus, this mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 and KP.3 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD.

Ty1: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Many mutant nanobodies do not show binding, but several show moderate binding to the Wuhan RBD. One mutant nanobody with mutations V32F, G59D, N45S, and F32S binds to the Wuhan RBD (strong binding) and the JN.1 RBD (moderate binding). This mutant introduces specific binding to JN.1 that the wild-type does not possess, and it increases binding to the Wuhan RBD. Additionally, there are is one mutant with weak, non-specific binding to BSA and other RBD strains.

VHH-72: The wild-type only binds to the Wuhan RBD. Most mutants show binding to the Wuhan RBD as well, including several with a higher binding level than the wild-type. Two mutant nanobodies bind non-specifically to BSA and several RBD strains. No mutant nanobody shows specific binding to any strain other than the Wuhan RBD.

Based on these results, you must decide how to proceed to design further improved nanobodies for recent variants of SARS-CoV-2. You may either continue to pursue identifying binders to the KP.3 RBD or you may decide to target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Your team should select another 92 mutant nanobodies to test experimentally. This time, you do not have to test an equal number of mutants for each wild-type nanobody, and you may even entirely leave out some wild-type nanobodies. You can either start again from the wild-type nanobodies and introduce mutations or begin with one of the previously designed nanobodies. You may use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in similar ways as your previous design process, or you can change the design workflow. As a reminder, ESM is antigen-agnostic and improves general nanobody quality while AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta are antigen-specific and focus on binding to the selected antigen. You should aim to design nanobodies that bind specifically to the RBD of recent variants of SARS-CoV-2 and do not bind non-specifically to BSA. You should provide a rationale for all of your decisions.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you continue to target the KP.3 RBD or will you target a different strain or strains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD?

2. Which wild-type nanobody or nanobodies will you select for further improvement?

3. How many mutant nanobodies will you design for each of those wild-type nanobodies (92 total)?

4. Will you begin with the wild-type nanobody itself and introduce mutations, or will you begin with one of the previously designed mutant nanobodies?

5. If you are beginning with previously designed mutant nanobodies, which one or ones will you start with?

6. Will you continue to use the same general ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta design pipeline you previously used, or will you design a new computational pipeline?

Your summary should take the following form.

## Principal Investigator

### Agenda

Our goal is to refine and advance our strategy for designing nanobodies that effectively target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, focusing not only on the newest variant, KP.3, but also considering broader activity against other circulating and past variants such as JN.1 and BA.2. We must decide which specific RBD strains to target, the wild-type nanobodies to improve, how to design and select 92 mutant nanobodies, and whether to update our computational pipeline. The designed nanobodies should demonstrate specific binding to the target RBDs and avoid non-specific interactions.

### Team Member Input

- **Immunologist**: Emphasized targeting conserved and accessible epitopes to achieve cross-variant binding. Suggested assays like cell-based neutralization and SPR for further validation.
  
- **Machine Learning Specialist**: Recommended adjusting scoring weights to better predict specificity, using ensemble methods to refine structural predictions, and focusing resources on top candidates for MD simulations.

- **Computational Biologist**: Proposed selective MD simulations for top candidates to assess stability, integrating insights into structural predictions, and refining the computational approach based on dynamic behavior.

- **Scientific Critic**: Emphasized the importance of a structured feedback loop between computational predictions and experimental validation. Suggested using comprehensive metrics to adjust models iteratively.

### Recommendation

**Target and Design Strategy**: We should target the KP.3, JN.1, and BA.2 variants, leveraging the observed cross-reactivity of certain mutants. Focus efforts on Nb21 and Ty1 nanobodies, as they have shown promise in expanding binding profiles beyond the Wuhan strain. Design mutants starting from these successful previously designed nanobodies, refining mutations to enhance cross-variant binding while reducing non-specific interactions.

**Computational Pipeline Enhancement**: Implement ensemble predictions and adjust the scoring weights to emphasize Rosetta's binding energy for more accurate specificity predictions. Selectively apply MD simulations to refine top candidates further, ensuring computational resources are efficiently used.
