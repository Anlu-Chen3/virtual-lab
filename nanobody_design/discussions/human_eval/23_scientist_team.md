This should involve an interdisciplinary approach that integrates domain-specific feature engineering, robust data augmentation, and ethical oversight from the outset. By establishing strong partnerships with clinical institutions for real-world validation and maintaining transparent communication about our methodologies and findings, we can ensure our models are both clinically relevant and ethically sound.

### Next Steps

1. **Collaborative Framework Development**: Set up a collaborative development environment using platforms like JupyterHub and integrate signal processing and bioinformatics tools. Facilitate regular interdisciplinary workshops to align technical and clinical objectives.

2. **Data Strategy Implementation**: Prioritize and implement data augmentation techniques based on clinical relevance. Integrate these into pre-processing pipelines and establish a robust evaluation framework with metrics aligned to clinical goals.

3. **Clinical Partnerships and Trials**: Initiate partnerships with hospitals and research institutions to facilitate real-world validation studies. Design clinical trials to validate model outputs against standard clinical assessments.

4. **Ethical and Regulatory Planning**: Establish an ethical oversight committee to integrate ethics by design into our workflow. Develop an accountability framework and schedule regular audits to ensure compliance and monitor for biases.

5. **Engagement and Training**: Develop engagement strategies with clinicians and patients to gather feedback and refine models. Provide training and support materials for clinical integration and usability.

By following these steps, we aim to create self-supervised learning models for biomedical signals that are technically robust, clinically valuable, and ethically responsible.
