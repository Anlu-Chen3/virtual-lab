This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Data Valuation Techniques in Biomedical Research

Problem: The relative value of individual data contributions in training biomedical AI models is poorly understood, impacting data-sharing incentives.

Research Question: What techniques can be used to quantify the marginal utility of data points in biomedical datasets?

You need to select a team of scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion on this topic. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list. Please write the full team of agents as a Python list of Agent objects. (Note that every agent should have "model=model" as the last parameter.)

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
    model=model,
)

Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Certainly! Based on the agenda provided, here is a list of team members that I would like to invite to a discussion on the topic of data valuation techniques in biomedical research:

```python
team_members = [
    Agent(
        title="Data Scientist",
        expertise="data analysis and machine learning",
        goal="develop techniques for quantifying the marginal utility of data points",
        role="design and implement algorithms to evaluate data contributions",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Biostatistician",
        expertise="statistical methods in biomedical research",
        goal="apply statistical techniques to assess data quality and value",
        role="provide statistical insights into data valuation methodologies",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Bioinformatician",
        expertise="integration and analysis of complex biological data",
        goal="ensure the relevance and applicability of data valuation techniques to biomedical datasets",
        role="advise on the biological context and significance of data",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Ethical AI Specialist",
        expertise="ethics in artificial intelligence and data sharing",
        goal="address ethical considerations in data valuation and sharing",
        role="ensure the project adheres to ethical guidelines and promotes fair data use",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="AI/ML Engineer",
        expertise="development and deployment of AI/ML models",
        goal="optimize model training processes with valuable data",
        role="implement efficient practices for incorporating high-value data into models",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Economist",
        expertise="valuation and incentives in data economy",
        goal="explore economic models to incentivize data sharing based on data value",
        role="provide insights into the economic implications of data valuation",
        model=model,
    ),
]
```

This diverse team brings together experts in AI, statistics, bioinformatics, ethics, and economics to comprehensively address the research question of quantifying the marginal utility of data points in biomedical datasets.
