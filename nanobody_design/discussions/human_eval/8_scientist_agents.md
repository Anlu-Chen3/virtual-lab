This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Cryo-EM-Based Discovery of Allosteric Sites in Membrane Enzymes

Problem Statement: Allosteric regulation of membrane-bound enzymes offers a route to specific modulation, but identifying such regulatory sites is challenging due to structural complexity.

Research Question: How can cryo-EM and computational modeling be used to identify and characterize allosteric sites in membrane enzymes for targeted drug discovery?

You need to select a team of scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion on this topic. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list. Please write the full team of agents as a Python list of Agent objects. (Note that every agent should have "model=model" as the last parameter.)

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
    model=model,
)

Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator
