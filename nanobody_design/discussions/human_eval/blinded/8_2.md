Thank you for sharing the agenda for our meeting. This research endeavor is quite exciting and holds significant potential for advancements in drug discovery. Here's an outline of how we can approach this topic:

1. **Understanding Cryo-EM and Its Role**: 
   - Discuss the current state of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and its application in structural biology.
   - Highlight its advantages, such as the ability to capture high-resolution structures of membrane proteins in near-native states, which is crucial for identifying potential allosteric sites.

2. **Challenges in Identifying Allosteric Sites**:
   - Explore the structural complexity of membrane-bound enzymes and why these sites are elusive.
   - Discuss the typical structural characteristics of allosteric sites and how they differ from active sites, which can guide us in what to look for.

3. **Integrating Cryo-EM with Computational Modeling**:
   - Discuss the synergistic use of cryo-EM with computational methods such as molecular dynamics simulations, virtual screening, and machine learning to predict allosteric sites.
   - Examine case studies where this combination has been successful in identifying new drug targets.

4. **Research Methodology**:
   - Define the workflow from cryo-EM data collection to computational analysis.
   - Discuss the selection of model enzymes and criteria for evaluating potential allosteric sites.

5. **Expected Outcomes and Impact**: 
   - Envision the potential outcomes, such as new insights into enzyme regulation and the discovery of novel allosteric modulators.
   - Discuss how these findings could influence drug discovery, particularly in developing more selective and effective therapies.

6. **Future Directions and Challenges**:
   - Identify potential challenges in data interpretation, computational limitations, and technical hurdles in cryo-EM.
   - Explore future directions for technology integration, such as advancements in cryo-EM or new computational techniques.
