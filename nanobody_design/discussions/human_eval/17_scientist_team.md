3. **Develop Initial Model Prototypes**: Utilize existing NLP models with transfer learning, integrating feedback from initial patient tests to refine simplification strategies.

4. **Implement Compliance Protocols**: Develop and test compliance modules within the AI system, ensuring real-time monitoring and regular updates based on regulatory changes.

5. **Conduct Pilot Studies**: Initiate small-scale pilot studies in clinical settings to evaluate the AI's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, gathering data to further refine the models.

These steps will guide our progress toward developing an AI tool that effectively simplifies medical documentation while maintaining ethical integrity and patient empowerment.
