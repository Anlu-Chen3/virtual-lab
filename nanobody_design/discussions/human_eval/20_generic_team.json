Here are my thoughts on the agenda:\n\n1. **Current Understanding and Approaches**: We've primarily been using traditional affinity purification tags, but there's potential in expanding to next-generation tags that offer higher specificity and reduced background noise. We should consider benchmarking against newer technologies like split GFP tags.\n\n2. **Computational Approaches**: There's a lot of untapped potential in machine learning algorithms, particularly in the design phase of fusion tags. We could look into leveraging AI models that predict tag functionality based on sequence characteristics and structural data.\n\n3. **Experimental Approaches**: Our current experimental techniques rely heavily on mass spectrometry for validation, which is robust but can be resource-intensive. Exploring high-throughput screening methods could help us evaluate more candidates in parallel and reduce time.\n\n4. **Integration of Approaches**: A dual approach where computational predictions are experimentally validated could streamline our workflow. Establishing a feedback loop between computational predictions and experimental results could improve the iterative design process.\n\n5. **Challenges and Limitations**: A significant challenge is the potential for off-target effects with new tags. Addressing this through predictive models that can estimate off-target binding might be beneficial.\n\n6. **Future Directions**: Collaborating with computational biologists could accelerate our development of predictive models.
