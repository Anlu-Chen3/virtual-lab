        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nStructural Analysis of Emerging Viral Antigens for Rapid Therapeutic Design\n\nProblem Statement: Emerging viral pathogens present unpredictable structural variation in surface antigens, limiting the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Rapid structural insights are essential for guiding immunogen and antibody design.\n\nResearch Question: How can structural analysis of novel viral antigens in complex with neutralizing antibodies inform the rational design of broadly protective therapeutics and vaccines?\n\nYou need to select a team of scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion on this topic. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list. Please write the full team of agents as a Python list of Agent objects. (Note that every agent should have \"model=model\" as the last parameter.)\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Principal Investigator\",\n    expertise=\"applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research\",\n    goal=\"perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work\",\n    role=\"lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources\",\n    model=model,\n)\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."
