## Assistant 1

**Assistant 1:**

Thank you, Assistant Lead. I appreciate the structured approach to this discussion. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Understanding Self-Supervised Learning**: Self-supervised learning can be incredibly useful in our context as it allows models to learn representations from the data itself without requiring explicit labels. This approach could be particularly effective with biomedical signals where obtaining labels is both costly and time-consuming.

2. **Current Techniques**: Techniques like contrastive learning, where models are trained to differentiate between similar and dissimilar data points, have shown promise in other fields and might be worth exploring. Additionally, methods such as predictive coding, where the model learns by predicting future signal segments, could also be beneficial.

3. **Challenges and Solutions**: A potential challenge is the inherent noise and variability in biomedical signals, which might lead to confounding the learning process. I propose that we develop robust preprocessing methods to clean the signals before applying self-supervised learning techniques.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Besides traditional metrics like accuracy and F1-score, I suggest considering domain-specific metrics such as clinical relevance or diagnostic utility, which might offer more insight into the practical applicability of our models.

5. **Data Sources**: We should explore collaborations with clinical institutions to access larger datasets. Public repositories like PhysioNet might be a good start, but we may need to augment these with additional, domain-specific data.

By focusing on these areas, I believe we can make meaningful progress in applying self-supervised learning to biomedical signal processing. I look forward to hearing other perspectives and refining these ideas.

**Assistant 2:**

Thank you, Assistant Lead, and thank you, Assistant 1, for those insights. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Understanding Self-Supervised Learning**: I agree that self-supervised learning is promising for our task. I’d like to emphasize its strength in learning representations from unlabeled data, which is crucial given the scarcity of annotated biomedical signals.

2. **Current Techniques**: Building on what Assistant 1 mentioned, I’d like to suggest exploring sequence-to-sequence learning tasks where the model learns to transform one part of the signal to another. This could help the model understand temporal dependencies, which are critical for biomedical signals.

3. **Challenges and Solutions**: While preprocessing is important, I believe the challenge also lies in developing self-supervised tasks that are both informative and non-trivial. We might need to involve domain experts to ensure these tasks are biologically meaningful, which could enhance the model’s learning.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Echoing Assistant 1, I think we should adopt a comprehensive evaluation strategy. In addition to model performance, we should assess the interpretability of our results, which is particularly important in healthcare applications.

5. **Data Sources**: I believe there is also potential in using synthetic data to supplement real data. Generating synthetic biomedical signals can help us test the robustness and generalizability of our models in controlled settings.

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the discussion so far:

1. **Understanding Self-Supervised Learning**: I completely agree with the potential of self-supervised learning for this task. It allows us to utilize large amounts of unlabeled data, which is a huge advantage given our data limitations.

2. **Current Techniques**: I appreciate the suggestions made by both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2. In addition to those, I propose considering masked signal modeling, where parts of the signal are masked, and the model is trained to predict the missing parts. This technique has been effective in other domains, such as natural language processing.

3. **Challenges and Solutions**: I want to emphasize the variability across different signal types and individual differences in subjects, which can be challenging. Developing an adaptable framework that can generalize across these variations is crucial. Transfer learning might be one way to tackle this, by training on a broader dataset and fine-tuning on specific datasets.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: I agree that both performance and interpretability are key. Another important metric could be the computational efficiency of the models, given that some biomedical applications require near real-time processing.
