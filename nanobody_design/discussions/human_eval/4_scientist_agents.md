This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Structural Characterization of AAV Capsid Variants for Improved Gene Delivery

Problem Statement: The efficiency and specificity of AAV-based gene therapies are limited by immune recognition and suboptimal tissue targeting.

Research Question: How do engineered modifications to AAV capsids alter their structure and receptor-binding properties, and how can these insights be used to optimize gene delivery vectors?

You need to select a team of scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion on this topic. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list. Please write the full team of agents as a Python list of Agent objects. (Note that every agent should have "model=model" as the last parameter.)

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
    model=model,
)

Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Based on the agenda and the research project needs, I propose the following team of experts to help address the problem of optimizing AAV capsid variants for improved gene delivery:

```python
team_members = [
    Agent(
        title="Structural Biologist",
        expertise="cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography of viral capsids",
        goal="characterize the structural changes in engineered AAV capsid variants",
        role="determine the structural alterations introduced by modifications and analyze their implications for receptor binding and immune evasion",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Molecular Biologist",
        expertise="AAV vector engineering and gene therapy",
        goal="develop genetically modified AAV capsid variants",
        role="engineer and validate AAV capsid variants with enhanced tissue targeting and reduced immune recognition",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Computational Biologist",
        expertise="bioinformatics and structural modeling of protein interactions",
        goal="simulate the interactions between engineered AAV capsids and cellular receptors",
        role="use computational tools to predict how modifications affect receptor binding and specificity",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Immunologist",
        expertise="immune response to viral vectors",
        goal="assess the immunogenicity of engineered AAV capsid variants",
        role="conduct experiments to evaluate how modifications impact immune recognition and potential for immune evasion",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Data Scientist",
        expertise="machine learning and data analysis in biomedical research",
        goal="analyze data from structural, molecular, and immunological studies",
        role="apply AI and machine learning to integrate diverse data sets and identify patterns that inform capsid optimization",
        model=model,
    ),
]
```

This team combines expertise in structural biology, vector engineering, computational modeling, immunology, and data science to address the multidisciplinary challenges presented by the project. Their collective efforts will help us understand how engineered modifications affect AAV capsid function and how these insights can be used to enhance gene delivery efficacy and specificity.
