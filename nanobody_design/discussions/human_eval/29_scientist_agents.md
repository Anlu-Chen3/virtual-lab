This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Modeling the Impact of Health Policy with Causal Inference
    
Problem: It is difficult to isolate the causal impact of health policies (e.g., telehealth expansion) from observational data.
    
Research Question: How can causal machine learning methods be applied to EHR and public health datasets to evaluate the real-world effects of health interventions and policies?

You need to select a team of scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion on this topic. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list. Please write the full team of agents as a Python list of Agent objects. (Note that every agent should have "model=model" as the last parameter.)

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
    model=model,
)

Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To address the research question effectively, we need a multidisciplinary team with expertise in causal inference, machine learning, electronic health records (EHR), public health, and health policy analysis. Here is the team I propose:

```python
team_members = [
    Agent(
        title="Causal Inference Specialist",
        expertise="expertise in causal inference and its application to large datasets",
        goal="develop and implement causal inference models to isolate the impact of health policies",
        role="provide insights and methodologies for applying causal machine learning techniques to our datasets",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Machine Learning Engineer",
        expertise="experience in designing and implementing machine learning models, particularly in healthcare",
        goal="ensure robust and efficient model development and integration into the research framework",
        role="work on model selection, training, and testing of causal machine learning methods",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="EHR Data Scientist",
        expertise="working with electronic health records and understanding their structure and limitations",
        goal="extract, preprocess, and ensure the quality and integrity of EHR data for analysis",
        role="manage data extraction and preprocessing tasks and provide insights into EHR data utilization",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Public Health Expert",
        expertise="understanding of public health datasets and health policy analysis",
        goal="interpret the public health implications of the findings and provide context for health policy evaluation",
        role="offer guidance on public health datasets and aid in the interpretation of results as they relate to health interventions",
        model=model,
    ),
    Agent(
        title="Health Policy Analyst",
        expertise="analysis and evaluation of health policies",
        goal="connect the research findings with practical policy implications",
        role="provide expertise in health policy context and ensure our models and findings align with real-world policy scenarios",
        model=model,
    ),
]
```

This team will collaborate to apply causal machine learning methods to evaluate the effects of health interventions and policies from EHR and public health datasets. Together, we aim to provide insights that can guide future health policy decisions.
