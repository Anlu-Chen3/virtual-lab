        "message": "**Meeting Agenda: Data Valuation Techniques in Biomedical Research**\n\n**1. Introduction**\n   - Brief overview of the importance of data valuation in biomedical research.\n   - Discuss the current challenges in understanding the value of individual data contributions.\n\n**2. Problem Statement**\n   - Explore how the lack of understanding of data value impacts data-sharing incentives.\n   - Explain why this is a significant problem in the context of training biomedical AI models.\n\n**3. Research Question**\n   - Clarify the goal: Identifying techniques to quantify the marginal utility of data points in biomedical datasets.\n\n**4. Methodologies for Data Valuation**\n   - **Shapley Value**: Discuss its application in evaluating the contribution of individual data points by distributing the total value of a dataset among its contributors fairly.\n   - **Influence Functions**: Explore this technique, which helps understand the impact of each data point on the training process by approximating the change in model parameters.\n   - **Leave-One-Out Analysis**: Examine how removing individual data points affects model performance, providing insights into their contribution.\n   - **Data Shapley**: A specialized adaptation of the Shapley value concept for machine learning, particularly useful for understanding the value of data in training models.\n\n**5. Considerations and Challenges**\n   - Discuss the computational complexity of these techniques, especially with large datasets.\n   - Explore potential biases in data valuation arising from imbalanced datasets or model selection.\n   - Consider ethical implications and privacy concerns in valuing individual data points.\n\n**6. Practical Implications**\n   - How improved data valuation can enhance data-sharing incentives and collaborations in biomedical research.\n   - Potential policy recommendations for data-sharing frameworks that recognize and reward data contributions.\n\n**7. Next Steps and Actions**\n   - Identify further research needed to refine these techniques for biomedical applications.\n   - Consider collaborative opportunities to apply these methods to existing biomedical datasets for validation.\n\n**8. Open Discussion and Q&A**\n   - Address any questions or additional points you may have.\n   - Discuss any specific datasets or models you have in mind for applying these techniques.\n\nWith this agenda, we aim to explore both theoretical and practical aspects of data valuation in biomedical research and identify actionable pathways to enhance data-sharing and model development. How does this align with your current goals or questions?"
