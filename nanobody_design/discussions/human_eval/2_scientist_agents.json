        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nMechanistic Study of Host Receptors Exploited by Bacterial Pathogens\n\nProblem Statement: Many bacterial pathogens exploit host membrane receptors for adhesion, invasion, or immune evasion, yet the molecular details of these interactions remain poorly characterized.\n\nResearch Question: What are the structural and biochemical mechanisms by which bacterial virulence factors interact with human receptors, and how can these interactions be targeted to prevent infection?\n\nYou need to select a team of scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion on this topic. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list. Please write the full team of agents as a Python list of Agent objects. (Note that every agent should have \"model=model\" as the last parameter.)\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Principal Investigator\",\n    expertise=\"applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research\",\n    goal=\"perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work\",\n    role=\"lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources\",\n    model=model,\n)\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."
