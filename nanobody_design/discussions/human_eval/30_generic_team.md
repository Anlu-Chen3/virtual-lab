2. **Usability and Accessibility**: Utilize heatmaps, A/B testing, and user journey analytics to optimize usability. Regular prototype testing and contextual inquiries should guide continuous improvement.

3. **Data Privacy and Security**: Develop a modular security configuration interface with real-time AI assistance and regular educational webinars to ensure users are informed and secure.

4. **Validation and Deployment**: Select diverse pilot sites with existing digital infrastructure and develop a standardized framework for evaluating results across settings.

5. **Feedback and Iteration**: Establish a structured mentorship program with digital collaboration tools and gamification elements to encourage engagement and skill development.

This recommendation balances the need for robust, interpretable models with user accessibility and data security, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly platform.

### Next Steps

1. **Platform Development**: Begin developing the platform with a focus on tiered interpretability features and usability enhancements.
   
2. **Pilot Program**: Identify potential pilot sites and establish partnerships to facilitate testing and feedback collection.

3. **Security Framework**: Work on the modular security configuration and set up a schedule for educational webinars on data privacy.

4. **Feedback Systems**: Develop and deploy feedback collection tools and establish the mentorship program structure.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review analytics and user feedback to iteratively refine and enhance the platform.

By following these steps, we can effectively address the agenda and contribute to the democratization of AI in healthcare.
